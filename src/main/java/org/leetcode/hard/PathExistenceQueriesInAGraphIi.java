 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given an integer n representing the number of nodes in a graph, labeled from 0 to n - 1.
 *
 *
 * You are also given an integer array nums of length n and an integer maxDiff.
 *
 *
 * An undirected edge exists between nodes i and j if the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[j] is at most maxDiff (i.e., |nums[i] - nums[j]| &lt;= maxDiff).
 *
 *
 * You are also given a 2D integer array queries. For each queries[i] = [ui, vi], find the minimum distance between nodes ui and vi. If no path exists between the two nodes, return -1 for that query.
 *
 *
 * Return an array answer, where answer[i] is the result of the ith query.
 *
 *
 * Note: The edges between the nodes are unweighted.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 5, nums = [1,8,3,4,2], maxDiff = 3, queries = [[0,3],[2,4]]
 *
 *
 * Output: [1,1]
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * The resulting graph is:
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			Query
 * 			Shortest Path
 * 			Minimum Distance
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			[0, 3]
 * 			0 → 3
 * 			1
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			[2, 4]
 * 			2 → 4
 * 			1
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Thus, the output is [1, 1].
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 5, nums = [5,3,1,9,10], maxDiff = 2, queries = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[4,3]]
 *
 *
 * Output: [1,2,-1,1]
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * The resulting graph is:
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			Query
 * 			Shortest Path
 * 			Minimum Distance
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			[0, 1]
 * 			0 → 1
 * 			1
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			[0, 2]
 * 			0 → 1 → 2
 * 			2
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			[2, 3]
 * 			None
 * 			-1
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			[4, 3]
 * 			3 → 4
 * 			1
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Thus, the output is [1, 2, -1, 1].
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: n = 3, nums = [3,6,1], maxDiff = 1, queries = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,2]]
 *
 *
 * Output: [0,-1,-1]
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * There are no edges between any two nodes because:
 *
 *
 * Nodes 0 and 1: |nums[0] - nums[1]| = |3 - 6| = 3 &gt; 1
 *
 * Nodes 0 and 2: |nums[0] - nums[2]| = |3 - 1| = 2 &gt; 1
 *
 * Nodes 1 and 2: |nums[1] - nums[2]| = |6 - 1| = 5 &gt; 1
 *
 * Thus, no node can reach any other node, and the output is [0, -1, -1].
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= n == nums.length &lt;= 105
 *
 * 0 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 105
 *
 * 0 &lt;= maxDiff &lt;= 105
 *
 * 1 &lt;= queries.length &lt;= 105
 *
 * queries[i] == [ui, vi]
 *
 * 0 &lt;= ui, vi &lt; n
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Sort the nodes according to <code>nums[i]</code>.
 * Hint 2: Can we use binary jumping?
 * Hint 3: Use binary jumping with a sparse table data structure.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Two Pointers, Binary Search, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Bit Manipulation, Graph Theory, Sorting).
