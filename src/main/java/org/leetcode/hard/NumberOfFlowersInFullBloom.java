 * <b>#2251 - Number of Flowers in Full Bloom</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Hard</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Hash Table, Binary Search, Sorting, Prefix Sum, Ordered Set</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array flowers, where flowers[i] = [starti, endi] means the ith flower will be in full bloom from starti to endi (inclusive). You are also given a 0-indexed integer array people of size n, where people[i] is the time that the ith person will arrive to see the flowers.
 *
 *
 * Return an integer array answer of size n, where answer[i] is the number of flowers that are in full bloom when the ith person arrives.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: flowers = [[1,6],[3,7],[9,12],[4,13]], people = [2,3,7,11]
 * Output: [1,2,2,2]
 * Explanation: The figure above shows the times when the flowers are in full bloom and when the people arrive.
 * For each person, we return the number of flowers in full bloom during their arrival.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: flowers = [[1,10],[3,3]], people = [3,3,2]
 * Output: [2,2,1]
 * Explanation: The figure above shows the times when the flowers are in full bloom and when the people arrive.
 * For each person, we return the number of flowers in full bloom during their arrival.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= flowers.length &lt;= 5 * 104
 *
 * flowers[i].length == 2
 *
 * 1 &lt;= starti &lt;= endi &lt;= 109
 *
 * 1 &lt;= people.length &lt;= 5 * 104
 *
 * 1 &lt;= people[i] &lt;= 109
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Notice that for any given time t, the number of flowers blooming at time t is equal to the number of flowers that have started blooming minus the number of flowers that have already stopped blooming.
 * Hint 2: We can obtain these values efficiently using binary search.
 * Hint 3: We can store the starting times in sorted order, which then allows us to binary search to find how many flowers have started blooming for a given time t.
 * Hint 4: We do the same for the ending times to find how many flowers have stopped blooming at time t.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Hash Table, Binary Search, Sorting, Prefix Sum, Ordered Set).
