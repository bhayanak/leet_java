/**
 * <b>#2398 - Maximum Number of Robots Within Budget</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Hard</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Binary Search, Queue, Sliding Window, Heap (Priority Queue), Prefix Sum, Monotonic Queue</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You have n robots. You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays, chargeTimes and runningCosts, both of length n. The ith robot costs chargeTimes[i] units to charge and costs runningCosts[i] units to run. You are also given an integer budget.
 *
 *
 * The total cost of running k chosen robots is equal to max(chargeTimes) + k * sum(runningCosts), where max(chargeTimes) is the largest charge cost among the k robots and sum(runningCosts) is the sum of running costs among the k robots.
 *
 *
 * Return the maximum number of consecutive robots you can run such that the total cost does not exceed budget.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: chargeTimes = [3,6,1,3,4], runningCosts = [2,1,3,4,5], budget = 25
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: 
 * It is possible to run all individual and consecutive pairs of robots within budget.
 * To obtain answer 3, consider the first 3 robots. The total cost will be max(3,6,1) + 3 * sum(2,1,3) = 6 + 3 * 6 = 24 which is less than 25.
 * It can be shown that it is not possible to run more than 3 consecutive robots within budget, so we return 3.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: chargeTimes = [11,12,19], runningCosts = [10,8,7], budget = 19
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: No robot can be run that does not exceed the budget, so we return 0.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * chargeTimes.length == runningCosts.length == n
 *
 * 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 5 * 104
 *
 * 1 &lt;= chargeTimes[i], runningCosts[i] &lt;= 105
 *
 * 1 &lt;= budget &lt;= 1015
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Use binary search to convert the problem into checking if we can find a specific number of consecutive robots within the budget.
 * Hint 2: Maintain a sliding window of the consecutive robots being considered.
 * Hint 3: Use either a map, deque, or heap to find the maximum charge times in the window efficiently.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Binary Search, Queue, Sliding Window, Heap (Priority Queue), Prefix Sum, Monotonic Queue).
