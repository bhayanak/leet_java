 * <b>#1326 - Minimum Number of Taps to Open to Water a Garden</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Hard</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Dynamic Programming, Greedy</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * There is a one-dimensional garden on the x-axis. The garden starts at the point 0 and ends at the point n. (i.e., the length of the garden is n).
 *
 *
 * There are n + 1 taps located at points [0, 1, ..., n] in the garden.
 *
 *
 * Given an integer n and an integer array ranges of length n + 1 where ranges[i] (0-indexed) means the i-th tap can water the area [i - ranges[i], i + ranges[i]] if it was open.
 *
 *
 * Return the minimum number of taps that should be open to water the whole garden, If the garden cannot be watered return -1.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 5, ranges = [3,4,1,1,0,0]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The tap at point 0 can cover the interval [-3,3]
 * The tap at point 1 can cover the interval [-3,5]
 * The tap at point 2 can cover the interval [1,3]
 * The tap at point 3 can cover the interval [2,4]
 * The tap at point 4 can cover the interval [4,4]
 * The tap at point 5 can cover the interval [5,5]
 * Opening Only the second tap will water the whole garden [0,5]
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 3, ranges = [0,0,0,0]
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: Even if you activate all the four taps you cannot water the whole garden.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 104
 *
 * ranges.length == n + 1
 *
 * 0 &lt;= ranges[i] &lt;= 100
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Create intervals of the area covered by each tap, sort intervals by the left end.
 * Hint 2: We need to cover the interval [0, n]. we can start with the first interval and out of all intervals that intersect with it we choose the one that covers the farthest point to the right.
 * Hint 3: What if there is a gap between intervals that is not covered ? we should stop and return -1 as there is some interval that cannot be covered.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Dynamic Programming, Greedy).
 * Start brute-force, then optimise: sorting, hashing, two pointers,
 * sliding window, binary search, backtracking, DP, or graph traversal.
 *
 * <h2>Complexity</h2>
 * Time: see implementation  |  Space: see implementation
