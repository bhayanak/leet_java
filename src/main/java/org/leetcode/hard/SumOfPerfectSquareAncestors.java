 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Hard</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Hash Table, Math, Tree, Depth-First Search, Counting, Number Theory</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given an integer n and an undirected tree rooted at node 0 with n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1. This is represented by a 2D array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates an undirected edge between nodes ui and vi.
 *
 *
 * You are also given an integer array nums, where nums[i] is the positive integer assigned to node i.
 *
 *
 * Define a value ti as the number of ancestors of node i such that the product nums[i] * nums[ancestor] is a perfect square.
 *
 *
 * Return the sum of all ti values for all nodes i in range [1, n - 1].
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *
 * In a rooted tree, the ancestors of node i are all nodes on the path from node i to the root node 0, excluding i itself.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], nums = [2,8,2]
 *
 *
 * Output: 3
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			i
 * 			Ancestors
 * 			nums[i] * nums[ancestor]
 * 			Square Check
 * 			ti
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			1
 * 			[0]
 * 			nums[1] * nums[0] = 8 * 2 = 16
 * 			16 is a perfect square
 * 			1
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			2
 * 			[1, 0]
 * 			nums[2] * nums[1] = 2 * 8 = 16
 *
 * 			nums[2] * nums[0] = 2 * 2 = 4
 * 			Both 4 and 16 are perfect squares
 * 			2
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Thus, the total number of valid ancestor pairs across all non-root nodes is 1 + 2 = 3.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], nums = [1,2,4]
 *
 *
 * Output: 1
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			i
 * 			Ancestors
 * 			nums[i] * nums[ancestor]
 * 			Square Check
 * 			ti
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			1
 * 			[0]
 * 			nums[1] * nums[0] = 2 * 1 = 2
 * 			2 is not a perfect square
 * 			0
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			2
 * 			[0]
 * 			nums[2] * nums[0] = 4 * 1 = 4
 * 			4 is a perfect square
 * 			1
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Thus, the total number of valid ancestor pairs across all non-root nodes is 1.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3]], nums = [1,2,9,4]
 *
 *
 * Output: 2
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			i
 * 			Ancestors
 * 			nums[i] * nums[ancestor]
 * 			Square Check
 * 			ti
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			1
 * 			[0]
 * 			nums[1] * nums[0] = 2 * 1 = 2
 * 			2 is not a perfect square
 * 			0
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			2
 * 			[0]
 * 			nums[2] * nums[0] = 9 * 1 = 9
 * 			9 is a perfect square
 * 			1
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			3
 * 			[1, 0]
 * 			nums[3] * nums[1] = 4 * 2 = 8
 *
 * 			nums[3] * nums[0] = 4 * 1 = 4
 * 			Only 4 is a perfect square
 * 			1
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Thus, the total number of valid ancestor pairs across all non-root nodes is 0 + 1 + 1 = 2.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 105
 *
 * edges.length == n - 1
 *
 * edges[i] = [ui, vi]
 *
 * 0 &lt;= ui, vi &lt;= n - 1
 *
 * nums.length == n
 *
 * 1 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 105
 *
 * The input is generated such that edges represents a valid tree.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Notice that the product <code>nums[i] * nums[ancestor]</code> is a perfect square if and only if both numbers have the same "square-free kernel" (i.e., after removing all even powers of primes, the remaining product is identical).
 * Hint 2: Precompute the square-free representation of every node's value using prime factorization up to <code>max(nums[i])</code>.
 * Hint 3: Perform a DFS from the root. While traversing down the tree, maintain a frequency map of the square-free values of the ancestors.
 * Hint 4: For each node, the number of valid ancestors equals the count of ancestors with the same square-free value.
 * Hint 5: Carefully backtrack the frequency map after finishing a subtree to maintain correctness.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Hash Table, Math, Tree, Depth-First Search, Counting, Number Theory).
