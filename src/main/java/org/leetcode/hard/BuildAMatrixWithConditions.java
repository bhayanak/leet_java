/**
 * <b>#2392 - Build a Matrix With Conditions</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Hard</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Graph Theory, Topological Sort, Matrix</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given a positive integer k. You are also given:
 *
 *
 * a 2D integer array rowConditions of size n where rowConditions[i] = [abovei, belowi], and
 *
 * a 2D integer array colConditions of size m where colConditions[i] = [lefti, righti].
 *
 * The two arrays contain integers from 1 to k.
 *
 *
 * You have to build a k x k matrix that contains each of the numbers from 1 to k exactly once. The remaining cells should have the value 0.
 *
 *
 * The matrix should also satisfy the following conditions:
 *
 *
 * The number abovei should appear in a row that is strictly above the row at which the number belowi appears for all i from 0 to n - 1.
 *
 * The number lefti should appear in a column that is strictly left of the column at which the number righti appears for all i from 0 to m - 1.
 *
 * Return any matrix that satisfies the conditions. If no answer exists, return an empty matrix.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: k = 3, rowConditions = [[1,2],[3,2]], colConditions = [[2,1],[3,2]]
 * Output: [[3,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,2,0]]
 * Explanation: The diagram above shows a valid example of a matrix that satisfies all the conditions.
 * The row conditions are the following:
 * - Number 1 is in row 1, and number 2 is in row 2, so 1 is above 2 in the matrix.
 * - Number 3 is in row 0, and number 2 is in row 2, so 3 is above 2 in the matrix.
 * The column conditions are the following:
 * - Number 2 is in column 1, and number 1 is in column 2, so 2 is left of 1 in the matrix.
 * - Number 3 is in column 0, and number 2 is in column 1, so 3 is left of 2 in the matrix.
 * Note that there may be multiple correct answers.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: k = 3, rowConditions = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1],[2,3]], colConditions = [[2,1]]
 * Output: []
 * Explanation: From the first two conditions, 3 has to be below 1 but the third conditions needs 3 to be above 1 to be satisfied.
 * No matrix can satisfy all the conditions, so we return the empty matrix.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 2 &lt;= k &lt;= 400
 *
 * 1 &lt;= rowConditions.length, colConditions.length &lt;= 104
 *
 * rowConditions[i].length == colConditions[i].length == 2
 *
 * 1 &lt;= abovei, belowi, lefti, righti &lt;= k
 *
 * abovei != belowi
 *
 * lefti != righti
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Can you think of the problem in terms of graphs?
 * Hint 2: What algorithm allows you to find the order of nodes in a graph?
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Graph Theory, Topological Sort, Matrix).
