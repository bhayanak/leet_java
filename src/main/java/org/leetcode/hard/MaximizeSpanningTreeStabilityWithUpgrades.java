/**
 * <b>#3600 - Maximize Spanning Tree Stability with Upgrades</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Hard</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Binary Search, Greedy, Union-Find, Graph Theory, Minimum Spanning Tree</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given an integer n, representing n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 and a list of edges, where edges[i] = [ui, vi, si, musti]:
 *
 *
 * ui and vi indicates an undirected edge between nodes ui and vi.
 *
 * si is the strength of the edge.
 *
 * musti is an integer (0 or 1). If musti == 1, the edge must be included in the spanning tree. These edges cannot be upgraded.
 *
 * You are also given an integer k, the maximum number of upgrades you can perform. Each upgrade doubles the strength of an edge, and each eligible edge (with musti == 0) can be upgraded at most once.
 *
 *
 * The stability of a spanning tree is defined as the minimum strength score among all edges included in it.
 *
 *
 * Return the maximum possible stability of any valid spanning tree. If it is impossible to connect all nodes, return -1.
 *
 *
 * Note: A spanning tree of a graph with n nodes is a subset of the edges that connects all nodes together (i.e. the graph is connected) without forming any cycles, and uses exactly n - 1 edges.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,2,1],[1,2,3,0]], k = 1
 *
 *
 * Output: 2
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * Edge [0,1] with strength = 2 must be included in the spanning tree.
 *
 * Edge [1,2] is optional and can be upgraded from 3 to 6 using one upgrade.
 *
 * The resulting spanning tree includes these two edges with strengths 2 and 6.
 *
 * The minimum strength in the spanning tree is 2, which is the maximum possible stability.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,4,0],[1,2,3,0],[0,2,1,0]], k = 2
 *
 *
 * Output: 6
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * Since all edges are optional and up to k = 2 upgrades are allowed.
 *
 * Upgrade edges [0,1] from 4 to 8 and [1,2] from 3 to 6.
 *
 * The resulting spanning tree includes these two edges with strengths 8 and 6.
 *
 * The minimum strength in the tree is 6, which is the maximum possible stability.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,1,1],[1,2,1,1],[2,0,1,1]], k = 0
 *
 *
 * Output: -1
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * All edges are mandatory and form a cycle, which violates the spanning tree property of acyclicity. Thus, the answer is -1.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 2 &lt;= n &lt;= 105
 *
 * 1 &lt;= edges.length &lt;= 105
 *
 * edges[i] = [ui, vi, si, musti]
 *
 * 0 &lt;= ui, vi &lt; n
 *
 * ui != vi
 *
 * 1 &lt;= si &lt;= 105
 *
 * musti is either 0 or 1.
 *
 * 0 &lt;= k &lt;= n
 *
 * There are no duplicate edges.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Sort the <code>edges</code> array in descending order of weights.
 * Hint 2: Try using binary search on <code>ans</code>.
 * Hint 3: Implement a <code>chk</code> function which first adds all the edges with <code>must = 1</code>, and then adds the edges with <code>must = 0</code>, using any remaining upgrades greedily.
 * Hint 4: Use a <code>DSU</code> with path compression and union by size/rank to maintain connected components.
 * Hint 5: Don't forget the case where you cannot form an MST because more than one component remains after processing all edges.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Binary Search, Greedy, Union-Find, Graph Theory, Minimum Spanning Tree).
