/**
 * <b>#2642 - Design Graph With Shortest Path Calculator</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Hard</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Graph Theory, Design, Heap (Priority Queue), Shortest Path</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * There is a directed weighted graph that consists of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1. The edges of the graph are initially represented by the given array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi, edgeCosti] meaning that there is an edge from fromi to toi with the cost edgeCosti.
 *
 *
 * Implement the Graph class:
 *
 *
 * Graph(int n, int[][] edges) initializes the object with n nodes and the given edges.
 *
 * addEdge(int[] edge) adds an edge to the list of edges where edge = [from, to, edgeCost]. It is guaranteed that there is no edge between the two nodes before adding this one.
 *
 * int shortestPath(int node1, int node2) returns the minimum cost of a path from node1 to node2. If no path exists, return -1. The cost of a path is the sum of the costs of the edges in the path.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input
 * ["Graph", "shortestPath", "shortestPath", "addEdge", "shortestPath"]
 * [[4, [[0, 2, 5], [0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 3]]], [3, 2], [0, 3], [[1, 3, 4]], [0, 3]]
 * Output
 * [null, 6, -1, null, 6]
 *
 * Explanation
 * Graph g = new Graph(4, [[0, 2, 5], [0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 3]]);
 * g.shortestPath(3, 2); // return 6. The shortest path from 3 to 2 in the first diagram above is 3 -&gt; 0 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 2 with a total cost of 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.
 * g.shortestPath(0, 3); // return -1. There is no path from 0 to 3.
 * g.addEdge([1, 3, 4]); // We add an edge from node 1 to node 3, and we get the second diagram above.
 * g.shortestPath(0, 3); // return 6. The shortest path from 0 to 3 now is 0 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 3 with a total cost of 2 + 4 = 6.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 100
 *
 * 0 &lt;= edges.length &lt;= n * (n - 1)
 *
 * edges[i].length == edge.length == 3
 *
 * 0 &lt;= fromi, toi, from, to, node1, node2 &lt;= n - 1
 *
 * 1 &lt;= edgeCosti, edgeCost &lt;= 106
 *
 * There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph at any point.
 *
 * At most 100 calls will be made for addEdge.
 *
 * At most 100 calls will be made for shortestPath.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: After adding each edge, update your graph with the new edge, and you can calculate the shortest path in your graph each time the shortestPath method is called.
 * Hint 2: Use dijkstra’s algorithm to calculate the shortest paths.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Graph Theory, Design, Heap (Priority Queue), Shortest Path).
