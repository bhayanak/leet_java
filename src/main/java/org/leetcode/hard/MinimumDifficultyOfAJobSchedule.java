/**
 * <b>#1335 - Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Hard</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Dynamic Programming</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You want to schedule a list of jobs in d days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the ith job, you have to finish all the jobs j where 0 &lt;= j &lt; i).
 *
 *
 * You have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the d days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done on that day.
 *
 *
 * You are given an integer array jobDifficulty and an integer d. The difficulty of the ith job is jobDifficulty[i].
 *
 *
 * Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return -1.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.
 * Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.
 * The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7 
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: If you finish a job per day you will still have a free day. you cannot find a schedule for the given jobs.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The schedule is one job per day. total difficulty will be 3.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= jobDifficulty.length &lt;= 300
 *
 * 0 &lt;= jobDifficulty[i] &lt;= 1000
 *
 * 1 &lt;= d &lt;= 10
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Use DP. Try to cut the array into d non-empty sub-arrays. Try all possible cuts for the array.
 * Hint 2: Use dp[i][j] where DP states are i the index of the last cut and j the number of remaining cuts. Complexity is O(n * n * d).
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Dynamic Programming).
 * Start brute-force, then optimise: sorting, hashing, two pointers,
 * sliding window, binary search, backtracking, DP, or graph traversal.
 *
 * <h2>Complexity</h2>
 * Time: see implementation  |  Space: see implementation
