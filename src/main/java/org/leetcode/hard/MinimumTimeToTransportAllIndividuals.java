 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given n individuals at a base camp who need to cross a river to reach a destination using a single boat. The boat can carry at most k people at a time. The trip is affected by environmental conditions that vary cyclically over m stages.
 *
 *
 * Each stage j has a speed multiplier mul[j]:
 *
 *
 * If mul[j] &gt; 1, the trip slows down.
 *
 * If mul[j] &lt; 1, the trip speeds up.
 *
 * Each individual i has a rowing strength represented by time[i], the time (in minutes) it takes them to cross alone in neutral conditions.
 *
 *
 * Rules:
 *
 *
 * A group g departing at stage j takes time equal to the maximum time[i] among its members, multiplied by mul[j] minutes to reach the destination.
 *
 * After the group crosses the river in time d, the stage advances by floor(d) % m steps.
 *
 * If individuals are left behind, one person must return with the boat. Let r be the index of the returning person, the return takes time[r] × mul[current_stage], defined as return_time, and the stage advances by floor(return_time) % m.
 *
 * Return the minimum total time required to transport all individuals. If it is not possible to transport all individuals to the destination, return -1.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 1, k = 1, m = 2, time = [5], mul = [1.0,1.3]
 *
 *
 * Output: 5.00000
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * Individual 0 departs from stage 0, so crossing time = 5 × 1.00 = 5.00 minutes.
 *
 * All team members are now at the destination. Thus, the total time taken is 5.00 minutes.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 3, k = 2, m = 3, time = [2,5,8], mul = [1.0,1.5,0.75]
 *
 *
 * Output: 14.50000
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * The optimal strategy is:
 *
 *
 * Send individuals 0 and 2 from the base camp to the destination from stage 0. The crossing time is max(2, 8) × mul[0] = 8 × 1.00 = 8.00 minutes. The stage advances by floor(8.00) % 3 = 2, so the next stage is (0 + 2) % 3 = 2.
 *
 * Individual 0 returns alone from the destination to the base camp from stage 2. The return time is 2 × mul[2] = 2 × 0.75 = 1.50 minutes. The stage advances by floor(1.50) % 3 = 1, so the next stage is (2 + 1) % 3 = 0.
 *
 * Send individuals 0 and 1 from the base camp to the destination from stage 0. The crossing time is max(2, 5) × mul[0] = 5 × 1.00 = 5.00 minutes. The stage advances by floor(5.00) % 3 = 2, so the final stage is (0 + 2) % 3 = 2.
 *
 * All team members are now at the destination. The total time taken is 8.00 + 1.50 + 5.00 = 14.50 minutes.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: n = 2, k = 1, m = 2, time = [10,10], mul = [2.0,2.0]
 *
 *
 * Output: -1.00000
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * Since the boat can only carry one person at a time, it is impossible to transport both individuals as one must always return. Thus, the answer is -1.00.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= n == time.length &lt;= 12
 *
 * 1 &lt;= k &lt;= 5
 *
 * 1 &lt;= m &lt;= 5
 *
 * 1 &lt;= time[i] &lt;= 100
 *
 * m == mul.length
 *
 * 0.5 &lt;= mul[i] &lt;= 2.0
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Use dynamic programming.
 * Hint 2: The states are <code>mask</code> of people left and <code>current_stage</code>.
 * Hint 3: The states form a cycle.
 * Hint 4: Consider the transitions as edges and the entire DP problem as a graph; all edge weights are positive.
 * Hint 5: We can use Dijkstra's algorithm.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Dynamic Programming, Bit Manipulation, Graph Theory, Heap (Priority Queue), Shortest Path, Bitmask).
