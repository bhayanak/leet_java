 * <b>#3812 - Minimum Edge Toggles on a Tree</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Hard</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Tree, Depth-First Search, Graph Theory, Topological Sort, Sorting</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given an undirected tree with n nodes, numbered from 0 to n - 1. It is represented by a 2D integer array edges​​​​​​​ of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
 *
 *
 * You are also given two binary strings start and target of length n. For each node x, start[x] is its initial color and target[x] is its desired color.
 *
 *
 * In one operation, you may pick an edge with index i and toggle both of its endpoints. That is, if the edge is [u, v], then the colors of nodes u and v each flip from '0' to '1' or from '1' to '0'.
 *
 *
 * Return an array of edge indices whose operations transform start into target. Among all valid sequences with minimum possible length, return the edge indices in increasing​​​​​​​ order.
 *
 *
 * If it is impossible to transform start into target, return an array containing a single element equal to -1.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * ​​​​​​​
 *
 * Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], start = "010", target = "100"
 *
 *
 * Output: [0]
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * Toggle edge with index 0, which flips nodes 0 and 1.
 *
 * ​​​​​​​The string changes from "010" to "100", matching the target.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[3,5],[1,6]], start = "0011000", target = "0010001"
 *
 *
 * Output: [1,2,5]
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * Toggle edge with index 1, which flips nodes 1 and 2.
 *
 * Toggle edge with index 2, which flips nodes 2 and 3.
 *
 * Toggle edge with index 5, which flips nodes 1 and 6.
 *
 * After these operations, the resulting string becomes "0010001", which matches the target.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * ​​​​​​​
 *
 * Input: n = 2, edges = [[0,1]], start = "00", target = "01"
 *
 *
 * Output: [-1]
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * There is no sequence of edge toggles that transforms "00" into "01". Therefore, we return [-1].
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 2 &lt;= n == start.length == target.length &lt;= 105
 *
 * edges.length == n - 1
 *
 * edges[i] = [ai, bi]
 *
 * 0 &lt;= ai, bi &lt; n
 *
 * start[i] is either '0' or '1'.
 *
 * target[i] is either '0' or '1'.
 *
 * The input is generated such that edges represents a valid tree.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Use a depth-first search (DFS).
 * Hint 2: Root the tree at any node. Traverse the tree, keeping track of flips applied from the parent to the subtree.
 * Hint 3: After processing a child subtree, determine whether the current node still needs to be flipped to match the target. If a flip is needed, record the corresponding edge.
 * Hint 4: Collect all flipped edges; if the transformation is impossible, return <code>[-1]</code>.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Tree, Depth-First Search, Graph Theory, Topological Sort, Sorting).
