 * <b>#3609 - Minimum Moves to Reach Target in Grid</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Hard</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Math</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given four integers sx, sy, tx, and ty, representing two points (sx, sy) and (tx, ty) on an infinitely large 2D grid.
 *
 *
 * You start at (sx, sy).
 *
 *
 * At any point (x, y), define m = max(x, y). You can either:
 *
 *
 * Move to (x + m, y), or
 *
 * Move to (x, y + m).
 *
 * Return the minimum number of moves required to reach (tx, ty). If it is impossible to reach the target, return -1.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: sx = 1, sy = 2, tx = 5, ty = 4
 *
 *
 * Output: 2
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * The optimal path is:
 *
 *
 * Move 1: max(1, 2) = 2. Increase the y-coordinate by 2, moving from (1, 2) to (1, 2 + 2) = (1, 4).
 *
 * Move 2: max(1, 4) = 4. Increase the x-coordinate by 4, moving from (1, 4) to (1 + 4, 4) = (5, 4).
 *
 * Thus, the minimum number of moves to reach (5, 4) is 2.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: sx = 0, sy = 1, tx = 2, ty = 3
 *
 *
 * Output: 3
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * The optimal path is:
 *
 *
 * Move 1: max(0, 1) = 1. Increase the x-coordinate by 1, moving from (0, 1) to (0 + 1, 1) = (1, 1).
 *
 * Move 2: max(1, 1) = 1. Increase the x-coordinate by 1, moving from (1, 1) to (1 + 1, 1) = (2, 1).
 *
 * Move 3: max(2, 1) = 2. Increase the y-coordinate by 2, moving from (2, 1) to (2, 1 + 2) = (2, 3).
 *
 * Thus, the minimum number of moves to reach (2, 3) is 3.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 2, ty = 2
 *
 *
 * Output: -1
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * It is impossible to reach (2, 2) from (1, 1) using the allowed moves. Thus, the answer is -1.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 0 &lt;= sx &lt;= tx &lt;= 109
 *
 * 0 &lt;= sy &lt;= ty &lt;= 109
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Work backwards from <code>(tx, ty)</code> to <code>(sx, sy)</code>, undoing one move at each step.
 * Hint 2: If the larger coordinate &gt;= 2 × (the smaller), undo by halving the larger; otherwise undo by subtracting the smaller from the larger.
 * Hint 3: Count these undo-steps until you hit <code>(sx, sy)</code> (return the count), or return -1 if you drop below or get stuck.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Math).
