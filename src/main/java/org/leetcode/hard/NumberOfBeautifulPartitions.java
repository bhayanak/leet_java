/**
 * <b>#2478 - Number of Beautiful Partitions</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Hard</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> String, Dynamic Programming, Prefix Sum</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given a string s that consists of the digits '1' to '9' and two integers k and minLength.
 *
 *
 * A partition of s is called beautiful if:
 *
 *
 * s is partitioned into k non-intersecting substrings.
 *
 * Each substring has a length of at least minLength.
 *
 * Each substring starts with a prime digit and ends with a non-prime digit. Prime digits are '2', '3', '5', and '7', and the rest of the digits are non-prime.
 *
 * Return the number of beautiful partitions of s. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 *
 *
 * A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "23542185131", k = 3, minLength = 2
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: There exists three ways to create a beautiful partition:
 * "2354 | 218 | 5131"
 * "2354 | 21851 | 31"
 * "2354218 | 51 | 31"
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "23542185131", k = 3, minLength = 3
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: There exists one way to create a beautiful partition: "2354 | 218 | 5131".
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: s = "3312958", k = 3, minLength = 1
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: There exists one way to create a beautiful partition: "331 | 29 | 58".
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= k, minLength &lt;= s.length &lt;= 1000
 *
 * s consists of the digits '1' to '9'.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Try using a greedy approach where you take as many digits as possible from the left of the string for each partition.
 * Hint 2: You can also use a dynamic programming approach, let an array dp where dp[i] is the solution of the problem for the prefix of the string ending at index i, the answer of the problem will be dp[n-1]. What are the transitions of this dp?
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (String, Dynamic Programming, Prefix Sum).
