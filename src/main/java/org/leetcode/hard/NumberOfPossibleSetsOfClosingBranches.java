 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * There is a company with n branches across the country, some of which are connected by roads. Initially, all branches are reachable from each other by traveling some roads.
 *
 *
 * The company has realized that they are spending an excessive amount of time traveling between their branches. As a result, they have decided to close down some of these branches (possibly none). However, they want to ensure that the remaining branches have a distance of at most maxDistance from each other.
 *
 *
 * The distance between two branches is the minimum total traveled length needed to reach one branch from another.
 *
 *
 * You are given integers n, maxDistance, and a 0-indexed 2D array roads, where roads[i] = [ui, vi, wi] represents the undirected road between branches ui and vi with length wi.
 *
 *
 * Return the number of possible sets of closing branches, so that any branch has a distance of at most maxDistance from any other.
 *
 *
 * Note that, after closing a branch, the company will no longer have access to any roads connected to it.
 *
 *
 * Note that, multiple roads are allowed.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 3, maxDistance = 5, roads = [[0,1,2],[1,2,10],[0,2,10]]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The possible sets of closing branches are:
 * - The set [2], after closing, active branches are [0,1] and they are reachable to each other within distance 2.
 * - The set [0,1], after closing, the active branch is [2].
 * - The set [1,2], after closing, the active branch is [0].
 * - The set [0,2], after closing, the active branch is [1].
 * - The set [0,1,2], after closing, there are no active branches.
 * It can be proven, that there are only 5 possible sets of closing branches.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 3, maxDistance = 5, roads = [[0,1,20],[0,1,10],[1,2,2],[0,2,2]]
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: The possible sets of closing branches are:
 * - The set [], after closing, active branches are [0,1,2] and they are reachable to each other within distance 4.
 * - The set [0], after closing, active branches are [1,2] and they are reachable to each other within distance 2.
 * - The set [1], after closing, active branches are [0,2] and they are reachable to each other within distance 2.
 * - The set [0,1], after closing, the active branch is [2].
 * - The set [1,2], after closing, the active branch is [0].
 * - The set [0,2], after closing, the active branch is [1].
 * - The set [0,1,2], after closing, there are no active branches.
 * It can be proven, that there are only 7 possible sets of closing branches.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: n = 1, maxDistance = 10, roads = []
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The possible sets of closing branches are:
 * - The set [], after closing, the active branch is [0].
 * - The set [0], after closing, there are no active branches.
 * It can be proven, that there are only 2 possible sets of closing branches.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10
 *
 * 1 &lt;= maxDistance &lt;= 105
 *
 * 0 &lt;= roads.length &lt;= 1000
 *
 * roads[i].length == 3
 *
 * 0 &lt;= ui, vi &lt;= n - 1
 *
 * ui != vi
 *
 * 1 &lt;= wi &lt;= 1000
 *
 * All branches are reachable from each other by traveling some roads.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Try all the possibilities of closing branches.
 * Hint 2: On the vertices that are not closed, use Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest paths.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Bit Manipulation, Graph Theory, Heap (Priority Queue), Enumeration, Shortest Path).
