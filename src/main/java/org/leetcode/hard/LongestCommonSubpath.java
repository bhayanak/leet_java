/**
 * <b>#1923 - Longest Common Subpath</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Hard</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Binary Search, Rolling Hash, Suffix Array, Hash Function</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * There is a country of n cities numbered from 0 to n - 1. In this country, there is a road connecting every pair of cities.
 *
 *
 * There are m friends numbered from 0 to m - 1 who are traveling through the country. Each one of them will take a path consisting of some cities. Each path is represented by an integer array that contains the visited cities in order. The path may contain a city more than once, but the same city will not be listed consecutively.
 *
 *
 * Given an integer n and a 2D integer array paths where paths[i] is an integer array representing the path of the ith friend, return the length of the longest common subpath that is shared by every friend's path, or 0 if there is no common subpath at all.
 *
 *
 * A subpath of a path is a contiguous sequence of cities within that path.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 5, paths = [[0,1,2,3,4],
 *                        [2,3,4],
 *                        [4,0,1,2,3]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The longest common subpath is [2,3].
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 3, paths = [[0],[1],[2]]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: There is no common subpath shared by the three paths.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: n = 5, paths = [[0,1,2,3,4],
 *                        [4,3,2,1,0]]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The possible longest common subpaths are [0], [1], [2], [3], and [4]. All have a length of 1.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 105
 *
 * m == paths.length
 *
 * 2 &lt;= m &lt;= 105
 *
 * sum(paths[i].length) &lt;= 105
 *
 * 0 &lt;= paths[i][j] &lt; n
 *
 * The same city is not listed multiple times consecutively in paths[i].
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: If there is a common path with length x, there is for sure a common path of length y where y &lt; x.
 * Hint 2: We can use binary search over the answer with the range [0, min(path[i].length)].
 * Hint 3: Using binary search, we want to verify if we have a common path of length m. We can achieve this using hashing.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Binary Search, Rolling Hash, Suffix Array, Hash Function).
 * Start brute-force, then optimise: sorting, hashing, two pointers,
 * sliding window, binary search, backtracking, DP, or graph traversal.
 *
 * <h2>Complexity</h2>
 * Time: see implementation  |  Space: see implementation
