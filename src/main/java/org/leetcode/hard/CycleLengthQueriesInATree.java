/**
 * <b>#2509 - Cycle Length Queries in a Tree</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Hard</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Tree, Binary Tree</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given an integer n. There is a complete binary tree with 2n - 1 nodes. The root of that tree is the node with the value 1, and every node with a value val in the range [1, 2n - 1 - 1] has two children where:
 *
 *
 * The left node has the value 2 * val, and
 *
 * The right node has the value 2 * val + 1.
 *
 * You are also given a 2D integer array queries of length m, where queries[i] = [ai, bi]. For each query, solve the following problem:
 *
 *
 * Add an edge between the nodes with values ai and bi.
 *
 * Find the length of the cycle in the graph.
 *
 * Remove the added edge between nodes with values ai and bi.
 *
 * Note that:
 *
 *
 * A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node, and each edge in the path is visited only once.
 *
 * The length of a cycle is the number of edges visited in the cycle.
 *
 * There could be multiple edges between two nodes in the tree after adding the edge of the query.
 *
 * Return an array answer of length m where answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 3, queries = [[5,3],[4,7],[2,3]]
 * Output: [4,5,3]
 * Explanation: The diagrams above show the tree of 23 - 1 nodes. Nodes colored in red describe the nodes in the cycle after adding the edge.
 * - After adding the edge between nodes 3 and 5, the graph contains a cycle of nodes [5,2,1,3]. Thus answer to the first query is 4. We delete the added edge and process the next query.
 * - After adding the edge between nodes 4 and 7, the graph contains a cycle of nodes [4,2,1,3,7]. Thus answer to the second query is 5. We delete the added edge and process the next query.
 * - After adding the edge between nodes 2 and 3, the graph contains a cycle of nodes [2,1,3]. Thus answer to the third query is 3. We delete the added edge.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 2, queries = [[1,2]]
 * Output: [2]
 * Explanation: The diagram above shows the tree of 22 - 1 nodes. Nodes colored in red describe the nodes in the cycle after adding the edge.
 * - After adding the edge between nodes 1 and 2, the graph contains a cycle of nodes [2,1]. Thus answer for the first query is 2. We delete the added edge.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 2 &lt;= n &lt;= 30
 *
 * m == queries.length
 *
 * 1 &lt;= m &lt;= 105
 *
 * queries[i].length == 2
 *
 * 1 &lt;= ai, bi &lt;= 2n - 1
 *
 * ai != bi
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Find the distance between nodes “a” and “b”.
 * Hint 2: distance(a, b) = depth(a) + depth(b) - 2 * depth(LCA(a, b)). Where depth(a) denotes depth from root to node “a” and LCA(a, b) denotes the lowest common ancestor of nodes “a” and “b”.
 * Hint 3: To find LCA(a, b), iterate over all ancestors of node “a” and check if it is the ancestor of node “b” too. If so, take the one with maximum depth.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Tree, Binary Tree).
