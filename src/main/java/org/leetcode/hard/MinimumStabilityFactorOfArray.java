 * <b>#3605 - Minimum Stability Factor of Array</b>

 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given an integer array nums and an integer maxC.
 *
 *
 * A subarray is called stable if the highest common factor (HCF) of all its elements is greater than or equal to 2.
 *
 *
 * The stability factor of an array is defined as the length of its longest stable subarray.
 *
 *
 * You may modify at most maxC elements of the array to any integer.
 *
 *
 * Return the minimum possible stability factor of the array after at most maxC modifications. If no stable subarray remains, return 0.
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *
 * The highest common factor (HCF) of an array is the largest integer that evenly divides all the array elements.
 *
 * A subarray of length 1 is stable if its only element is greater than or equal to 2, since HCF([x]) = x.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [3,5,10], maxC = 1
 *
 *
 * Output: 1
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * The stable subarray [5, 10] has HCF = 5, which has a stability factor of 2.
 *
 * Since maxC = 1, one optimal strategy is to change nums[1] to 7, resulting in nums = [3, 7, 10].
 *
 * Now, no subarray of length greater than 1 has HCF &gt;= 2. Thus, the minimum possible stability factor is 1.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [2,6,8], maxC = 2
 *
 *
 * Output: 1
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * The subarray [2, 6, 8] has HCF = 2, which has a stability factor of 3.
 *
 * Since maxC = 2, one optimal strategy is to change nums[1] to 3 and nums[2] to 5, resulting in nums = [2, 3, 5].
 *
 * Now, no subarray of length greater than 1 has HCF &gt;= 2. Thus, the minimum possible stability factor is 1.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: nums = [2,4,9,6], maxC = 1
 *
 *
 * Output: 2
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * The stable subarrays are:
 *
 *
 *
 * [2, 4] with HCF = 2 and stability factor of 2.
 *
 * [9, 6] with HCF = 3 and stability factor of 2.
 *
 *
 *
 * Since maxC = 1, the stability factor of 2 cannot be reduced due to two separate stable subarrays. Thus, the minimum possible stability factor is 2.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= n == nums.length &lt;= 105
 *
 * 1 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 109
 *
 * 0 &lt;= maxC &lt;= n
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Binary‐search the target length <code>k</code>
 * Hint 2: For each <code>k</code>, use fast range‐GCD queries
 * Hint 3: Greedily "hit" every window of size <code>k+1</code> with an edit if its <code>GCD &gt; 1</code>
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Math, Binary Search, Greedy, Segment Tree, Number Theory).
