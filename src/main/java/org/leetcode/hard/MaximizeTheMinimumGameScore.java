 * <b>#3449 - Maximize the Minimum Game Score</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Hard</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Binary Search, Greedy</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given an array points of size n and an integer m. There is another array gameScore of size n, where gameScore[i] represents the score achieved at the ith game. Initially, gameScore[i] == 0 for all i.
 *
 *
 * You start at index -1, which is outside the array (before the first position at index 0). You can make at most m moves. In each move, you can either:
 *
 *
 * Increase the index by 1 and add points[i] to gameScore[i].
 *
 * Decrease the index by 1 and add points[i] to gameScore[i].
 *
 * Note that the index must always remain within the bounds of the array after the first move.
 *
 *
 * Return the maximum possible minimum value in gameScore after at most m moves.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: points = [2,4], m = 3
 *
 *
 * Output: 4
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * Initially, index i = -1 and gameScore = [0, 0].
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			Move
 * 			Index
 * 			gameScore
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			Increase i
 * 			0
 * 			[2, 0]
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			Increase i
 * 			1
 * 			[2, 4]
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			Decrease i
 * 			0
 * 			[4, 4]
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * The minimum value in gameScore is 4, and this is the maximum possible minimum among all configurations. Hence, 4 is the output.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: points = [1,2,3], m = 5
 *
 *
 * Output: 2
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * Initially, index i = -1 and gameScore = [0, 0, 0].
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			Move
 * 			Index
 * 			gameScore
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			Increase i
 * 			0
 * 			[1, 0, 0]
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			Increase i
 * 			1
 * 			[1, 2, 0]
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			Decrease i
 * 			0
 * 			[2, 2, 0]
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			Increase i
 * 			1
 * 			[2, 4, 0]
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 			Increase i
 * 			2
 * 			[2, 4, 3]
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * The minimum value in gameScore is 2, and this is the maximum possible minimum among all configurations. Hence, 2 is the output.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 2 &lt;= n == points.length &lt;= 5 * 104
 *
 * 1 &lt;= points[i] &lt;= 106
 *
 * 1 &lt;= m &lt;= 109
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Can we use binary search?
 * Hint 2: What happens if you fix the game score as x?
 * Hint 3: We should go from i to (i + 1) back and forth, making the value for each index i (from left to right) no less than x.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Binary Search, Greedy).
