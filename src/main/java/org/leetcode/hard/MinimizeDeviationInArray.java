/**
 * <b>#1675 - Minimize Deviation in Array</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Hard</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Greedy, Heap (Priority Queue), Ordered Set</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given an array nums of n positive integers.
 *
 *
 * You can perform two types of operations on any element of the array any number of times:
 *
 *
 * If the element is even, divide it by 2.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * For example, if the array is [1,2,3,4], then you can do this operation on the last element, and the array will be [1,2,3,2].
 *
 *
 *
 * If the element is odd, multiply it by 2.
 *
 *
 *
 * For example, if the array is [1,2,3,4], then you can do this operation on the first element, and the array will be [2,2,3,4].
 *
 *
 *
 * The deviation of the array is the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.
 *
 *
 * Return the minimum deviation the array can have after performing some number of operations.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: You can transform the array to [1,2,3,2], then to [2,2,3,2], then the deviation will be 3 - 2 = 1.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [4,1,5,20,3]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: You can transform the array after two operations to [4,2,5,5,3], then the deviation will be 5 - 2 = 3.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: nums = [2,10,8]
 * Output: 3
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * n == nums.length
 *
 * 2 &lt;= n &lt;= 5 * 104
 *
 * 1 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 109
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Assume you start with the minimum possible value for each number so you can only multiply a number by 2 till it reaches its maximum possible value.
 * Hint 2: If there is a better solution than the current one, then it must have either its maximum value less than the current maximum value, or the minimum value larger than the current minimum value.
 * Hint 3: Since that we only increase numbers (multiply them by 2), we cannot decrease the current maximum value, so we must multiply the current minimum number by 2.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Greedy, Heap (Priority Queue), Ordered Set).
 * Start brute-force, then optimise: sorting, hashing, two pointers,
 * sliding window, binary search, backtracking, DP, or graph traversal.
 *
 * <h2>Complexity</h2>
 * Time: see implementation  |  Space: see implementation
