/**
 * <b>#1857 - Largest Color Value in a Directed Graph</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Hard</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Hash Table, String, Dynamic Programming, Graph Theory, Topological Sort, Memoization, Counting</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * There is a directed graph of n colored nodes and m edges. The nodes are numbered from 0 to n - 1.
 *
 *
 * You are given a string colors where colors[i] is a lowercase English letter representing the color of the ith node in this graph (0-indexed). You are also given a 2D array edges where edges[j] = [aj, bj] indicates that there is a directed edge from node aj to node bj.
 *
 *
 * A valid path in the graph is a sequence of nodes x1 -&gt; x2 -&gt; x3 -&gt; ... -&gt; xk such that there is a directed edge from xi to xi+1 for every 1 &lt;= i &lt; k. The color value of the path is the number of nodes that are colored the most frequently occurring color along that path.
 *
 *
 * Return the largest color value of any valid path in the given graph, or -1 if the graph contains a cycle.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: colors = "abaca", edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The path 0 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 4 contains 3 nodes that are colored "a" (red in the above image).
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: colors = "a", edges = [[0,0]]
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: There is a cycle from 0 to 0.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * n == colors.length
 *
 * m == edges.length
 *
 * 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 105
 *
 * 0 &lt;= m &lt;= 105
 *
 * colors consists of lowercase English letters.
 *
 * 0 &lt;= aj, bj &lt; n
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Use topological sort.
 * Hint 2: let dp[u][c] := the maximum count of vertices with color c of any path starting from vertex u. (by JerryJin2905)
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Hash Table, String, Dynamic Programming, Graph Theory, Topological Sort, Memoization, Counting).
 * Start brute-force, then optimise: sorting, hashing, two pointers,
 * sliding window, binary search, backtracking, DP, or graph traversal.
 *
 * <h2>Complexity</h2>
 * Time: see implementation  |  Space: see implementation
