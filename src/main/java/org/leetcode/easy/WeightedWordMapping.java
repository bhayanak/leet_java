 * <b>#3838 - Weighted Word Mapping</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Easy</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, String, Simulation</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given an array of strings words, where each string represents a word containing lowercase English letters.
 *
 *
 * You are also given an integer array weights of length 26, where weights[i] represents the weight of the ith lowercase English letter.
 *
 *
 * The weight of a word is defined as the sum of the weights of its characters.
 *
 *
 * For each word, take its weight modulo 26 and map the result to a lowercase English letter using reverse alphabetical order (0 -&gt; 'z', 1 -&gt; 'y', ..., 25 -&gt; 'a').
 *
 *
 * Return a string formed by concatenating the mapped characters for all words in order.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: words = ["abcd","def","xyz"], weights = [5,3,12,14,1,2,3,2,10,6,6,9,7,8,7,10,8,9,6,9,9,8,3,7,7,2]
 *
 *
 * Output: "rij"
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * The weight of "abcd" is 5 + 3 + 12 + 14 = 34. The result modulo 26 is 34 % 26 = 8, which maps to 'r'.
 *
 * The weight of "def" is 14 + 1 + 2 = 17. The result modulo 26 is 17 % 26 = 17, which maps to 'i'.
 *
 * The weight of "xyz" is 7 + 7 + 2 = 16. The result modulo 26 is 16 % 26 = 16, which maps to 'j'.
 *
 * Thus, the string formed by concatenating the mapped characters is "rij".
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: words = ["a","b","c"], weights = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
 *
 *
 * Output: "yyy"
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * Each word has weight 1. The result modulo 26 is 1 % 26 = 1, which maps to 'y'.
 *
 *
 * Thus, the string formed by concatenating the mapped characters is "yyy".
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: words = ["abcd"], weights = [7,5,3,4,3,5,4,9,4,2,2,7,10,2,5,10,6,1,2,2,4,1,3,4,4,5]
 *
 *
 * Output: "g"
 *
 *
 * Explanation:​​​​​​​
 *
 *
 * The weight of "abcd" is 7 + 5 + 3 + 4 = 19. The result modulo 26 is 19 % 26 = 19, which maps to 'g'.
 *
 *
 * Thus, the string formed by concatenating the mapped characters is "g".
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= words.length &lt;= 100
 *
 * 1 &lt;= words[i].length &lt;= 10
 *
 * weights.length == 26
 *
 * 1 &lt;= weights[i] &lt;= 100
 *
 * words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: For each word, sum character weights using <code>weights[c - 'a']</code>
 * Hint 2: Take the sum modulo <code>26</code>
 * Hint 3: Map the value to a character using reverse order: <code>char = 'z' - value</code>
 * Hint 4: Append all mapped characters in order to form the result string
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, String, Simulation).
