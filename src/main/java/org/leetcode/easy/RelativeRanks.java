     * LeetCode #506 – Relative Ranks
     * Difficulty: EASY
     * Topics: Array, Sorting, Heap (Priority Queue)
     *
     * You are given an integer array score of size n, where score[i] is the score
     * of the ith athlete in a competition. All the scores are guaranteed to be
     * unique.
     * 
     * 
     * The athletes are placed based on their scores, where the 1st place athlete
     * has the highest score, the 2nd place athlete has the 2nd highest score, and
     * so on. The placement of each athlete determines their rank:
     * 
     * 
     * The 1st place athlete's rank is "Gold Medal".
     * 
     * The 2nd place athlete's rank is "Silver Medal".
     * 
     * The 3rd place athlete's rank is "Bronze Medal".
     * 
     * For the 4th place to the nth place athlete, their rank is their placement
     * number (i.e., the xth place athlete's rank is "x").
     * 
     * Return an array answer of size n where answer[i] is the rank of the ith
     * athlete.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * Example 1:
     * 
     * Input: score = [5,4,3,2,1]
     * Output: ["Gold Medal","Silver Medal","Bronze Medal","4","5"]
     * Explanation: The placements are [1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th].
     * 
     * Example 2:
     * 
     * Input: score = [10,3,8,9,4]
     * Output: ["Gold Medal","5","Bronze Medal","Silver Medal","4"]
     * Explanation: The placements are [1st, 5th, 3rd, 2nd, 4th].
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * Constraints:
     * 
     * 
     * n == score.length
     * 
     * 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 104
     * 
     * 0 &lt;= score[i] &lt;= 106
     * 
     * All the values in score are unique.
      *
      * <p><b>Explanation:</b> Sorts the input first to simplify subsequent search or comparison steps.</p>
