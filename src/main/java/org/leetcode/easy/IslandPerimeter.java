     * LeetCode #463 – Island Perimeter
     * Difficulty: EASY
     * Topics: Array, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Matrix
     *
     * You are given row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1
     * represents land and grid[i][j] = 0 represents water.
     * 
     * 
     * Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid
     * is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e.,
     * one or more connected land cells).
     * 
     * 
     * The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected
     * to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1.
     * The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the
     * perimeter of the island.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * Example 1:
     * 
     * Input: grid = [[0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]
     * Output: 16
     * Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image above.
     * 
     * Example 2:
     * 
     * Input: grid = [[1]]
     * Output: 4
     * 
     * Example 3:
     * 
     * Input: grid = [[1,0]]
     * Output: 4
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * Constraints:
     * 
     * 
     * row == grid.length
     * 
     * col == grid[i].length
     * 
     * 1 &lt;= row, col &lt;= 100
     * 
     * grid[i][j] is 0 or 1.
     * 
     * There is exactly one island in grid.
      *
      * <p><b>Explanation:</b> Validates the condition by scanning the input and returning false on the first violation.</p>
      */
    // For each land cell, add 4; subtract 2 for each shared edge with neighbor
    /**
