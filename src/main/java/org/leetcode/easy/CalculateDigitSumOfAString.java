 * <b>#2243 - Calculate Digit Sum of a String</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Easy</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> String, Simulation</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given a string s consisting of digits and an integer k.
 *
 *
 * A round can be completed if the length of s is greater than k. In one round, do the following:
 *
 *
 * Divide s into consecutive groups of size k such that the first k characters are in the first group, the next k characters are in the second group, and so on. Note that the size of the last group can be smaller than k.
 *
 * Replace each group of s with a string representing the sum of all its digits. For example, "346" is replaced with "13" because 3 + 4 + 6 = 13.
 *
 * Merge consecutive groups together to form a new string. If the length of the string is greater than k, repeat from step 1.
 *
 * Return s after all rounds have been completed.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "11111222223", k = 3
 * Output: "135"
 * Explanation: 
 * - For the first round, we divide s into groups of size 3: "111", "112", "222", and "23".
 *   ​​​​​Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, and 2 + 3 = 5. 
 *   So, s becomes "3" + "4" + "6" + "5" = "3465" after the first round.
 * - For the second round, we divide s into "346" and "5".
 *   Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13, 5 = 5. 
 *   So, s becomes "13" + "5" = "135" after second round. 
 * Now, s.length &lt;= k, so we return "135" as the answer.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "00000000", k = 3
 * Output: "000"
 * Explanation: 
 * We divide s into "000", "000", and "00".
 * Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, and 0 + 0 = 0. 
 * s becomes "0" + "0" + "0" = "000", whose length is equal to k, so we return "000".
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 100
 *
 * 2 &lt;= k &lt;= 100
 *
 * s consists of digits only.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Try simulating the entire process to find the final answer.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (String, Simulation).
