/**
 * <b>#3531 - Count Covered Buildings</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Hash Table, Sorting</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given a positive integer n, representing an n x n city. You are also given a 2D grid buildings, where buildings[i] = [x, y] denotes a unique building located at coordinates [x, y].
 *
 *
 * A building is covered if there is at least one building in all four directions: left, right, above, and below.
 *
 *
 * Return the number of covered buildings.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 3, buildings = [[1,2],[2,2],[3,2],[2,1],[2,3]]
 *
 *
 * Output: 1
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * Only building [2,2] is covered as it has at least one building:
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * above ([1,2])
 *
 * below ([3,2])
 *
 * left ([2,1])
 *
 * right ([2,3])
 *
 *
 *
 * Thus, the count of covered buildings is 1.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 3, buildings = [[1,1],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
 *
 *
 * Output: 0
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * No building has at least one building in all four directions.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: n = 5, buildings = [[1,3],[3,2],[3,3],[3,5],[5,3]]
 *
 *
 * Output: 1
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * Only building [3,3] is covered as it has at least one building:
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * above ([1,3])
 *
 * below ([5,3])
 *
 * left ([3,2])
 *
 * right ([3,5])
 *
 *
 *
 * Thus, the count of covered buildings is 1.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 2 &lt;= n &lt;= 105
 *
 * 1 &lt;= buildings.length &lt;= 105 
 *
 * buildings[i] = [x, y]
 *
 * 1 &lt;= x, y &lt;= n
 *
 * All coordinates of buildings are unique.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Group buildings with the same x or y value together, and sort each group.
 * Hint 2: In each sorted list, the buildings that are not at the first or last positions are covered in that direction.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Hash Table, Sorting).
