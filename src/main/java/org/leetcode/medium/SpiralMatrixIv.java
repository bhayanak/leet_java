/**
 * <b>#2326 - Spiral Matrix IV</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Linked List, Matrix, Simulation</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given two integers m and n, which represent the dimensions of a matrix.
 *
 *
 * You are also given the head of a linked list of integers.
 *
 *
 * Generate an m x n matrix that contains the integers in the linked list presented in spiral order (clockwise), starting from the top-left of the matrix. If there are remaining empty spaces, fill them with -1.
 *
 *
 * Return the generated matrix.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: m = 3, n = 5, head = [3,0,2,6,8,1,7,9,4,2,5,5,0]
 * Output: [[3,0,2,6,8],[5,0,-1,-1,1],[5,2,4,9,7]]
 * Explanation: The diagram above shows how the values are printed in the matrix.
 * Note that the remaining spaces in the matrix are filled with -1.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: m = 1, n = 4, head = [0,1,2]
 * Output: [[0,1,2,-1]]
 * Explanation: The diagram above shows how the values are printed from left to right in the matrix.
 * The last space in the matrix is set to -1.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 105
 *
 * 1 &lt;= m * n &lt;= 105
 *
 * The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, m * n].
 *
 * 0 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 1000
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: First, generate an m x n matrix filled with -1s.
 * Hint 2: Navigate within the matrix at (i, j) with the help of a direction vector ⟨di, dj⟩. At (i, j), you need to decide if you can keep going in the current direction.
 * Hint 3: If you cannot keep going, rotate the direction vector clockwise by 90 degrees.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Linked List, Matrix, Simulation).
