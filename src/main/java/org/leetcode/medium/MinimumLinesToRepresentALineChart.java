 * <b>#2280 - Minimum Lines to Represent a Line Chart</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Math, Geometry, Sorting, Number Theory</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given a 2D integer array stockPrices where stockPrices[i] = [dayi, pricei] indicates the price of the stock on day dayi is pricei. A line chart is created from the array by plotting the points on an XY plane with the X-axis representing the day and the Y-axis representing the price and connecting adjacent points. One such example is shown below:
 *
 *
 * Return the minimum number of lines needed to represent the line chart.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: stockPrices = [[1,7],[2,6],[3,5],[4,4],[5,4],[6,3],[7,2],[8,1]]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * The diagram above represents the input, with the X-axis representing the day and Y-axis representing the price.
 * The following 3 lines can be drawn to represent the line chart:
 * - Line 1 (in red) from (1,7) to (4,4) passing through (1,7), (2,6), (3,5), and (4,4).
 * - Line 2 (in blue) from (4,4) to (5,4).
 * - Line 3 (in green) from (5,4) to (8,1) passing through (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), and (8,1).
 * It can be shown that it is not possible to represent the line chart using less than 3 lines.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: stockPrices = [[3,4],[1,2],[7,8],[2,3]]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * As shown in the diagram above, the line chart can be represented with a single line.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= stockPrices.length &lt;= 105
 *
 * stockPrices[i].length == 2
 *
 * 1 &lt;= dayi, pricei &lt;= 109
 *
 * All dayi are distinct.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: When will three adjacent points lie on the same line? How can we generalize this for all points?
 * Hint 2: Will calculating the slope of lines connecting adjacent points help us find the answer?
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Math, Geometry, Sorting, Number Theory).
