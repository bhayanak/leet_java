/**
 * <b>#1208 - Get Equal Substrings Within Budget</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> String, Binary Search, Sliding Window, Prefix Sum</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given two strings s and t of the same length and an integer maxCost.
 *
 *
 * You want to change s to t. Changing the ith character of s to ith character of t costs |s[i] - t[i]| (i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters).
 *
 *
 * Return the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of t with a cost less than or equal to maxCost. If there is no substring from s that can be changed to its corresponding substring from t, return 0.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: "abc" of s can change to "bcd".
 * That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "abcd", t = "cdef", maxCost = 3
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: Each character in s costs 2 to change to character in t,  so the maximum length is 1.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: s = "abcd", t = "acde", maxCost = 0
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: You cannot make any change, so the maximum length is 1.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 105
 *
 * t.length == s.length
 *
 * 0 &lt;= maxCost &lt;= 106
 *
 * s and t consist of only lowercase English letters.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Calculate the differences between s[i] and t[i].
 * Hint 2: Use a sliding window to track the longest valid substring.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (String, Binary Search, Sliding Window, Prefix Sum).
 * Start brute-force, then optimise: sorting, hashing, two pointers,
 * sliding window, binary search, backtracking, DP, or graph traversal.
 *
 * <h2>Complexity</h2>
 * Time: see implementation  |  Space: see implementation
