 * <b>#2925 - Maximum Score After Applying Operations on a Tree</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Dynamic Programming, Tree, Depth-First Search</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, and rooted at node 0. You are given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
 *
 *
 * You are also given a 0-indexed integer array values of length n, where values[i] is the value associated with the ith node.
 *
 *
 * You start with a score of 0. In one operation, you can:
 *
 *
 * Pick any node i.
 *
 * Add values[i] to your score.
 *
 * Set values[i] to 0.
 *
 * A tree is healthy if the sum of values on the path from the root to any leaf node is different than zero.
 *
 *
 * Return the maximum score you can obtain after performing these operations on the tree any number of times so that it remains healthy.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[2,4],[4,5]], values = [5,2,5,2,1,1]
 * Output: 11
 * Explanation: We can choose nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The value of the root is non-zero. Hence, the sum of values on the path from the root to any leaf is different than zero. Therefore, the tree is healthy and the score is values[1] + values[2] + values[3] + values[4] + values[5] = 11.
 * It can be shown that 11 is the maximum score obtainable after any number of operations on the tree.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]], values = [20,10,9,7,4,3,5]
 * Output: 40
 * Explanation: We can choose nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4.
 * - The sum of values on the path from 0 to 4 is equal to 10.
 * - The sum of values on the path from 0 to 3 is equal to 10.
 * - The sum of values on the path from 0 to 5 is equal to 3.
 * - The sum of values on the path from 0 to 6 is equal to 5.
 * Therefore, the tree is healthy and the score is values[0] + values[2] + values[3] + values[4] = 40.
 * It can be shown that 40 is the maximum score obtainable after any number of operations on the tree.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 2 &lt;= n &lt;= 2 * 104
 *
 * edges.length == n - 1
 *
 * edges[i].length == 2
 *
 * 0 &lt;= ai, bi &lt; n
 *
 * values.length == n
 *
 * 1 &lt;= values[i] &lt;= 109
 *
 * The input is generated such that edges represents a valid tree.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Let <code>dp[i]</code> be the maximum score we can get on the subtree rooted at <code>i</code> and <code>sum[i]</code> be the sum of all the values of the subtree rooted at <code>i</code>.
 * Hint 2: If we don’t take <code>value[i]</code> into the final score, we can take all the nodes of the subtrees rooted at <code>i</code>’s children.
 * Hint 3: If we take <code>value[i]</code> into the score, then each subtree rooted at its children should satisfy the constraints.
 * Hint 4: <code>dp[x] = max(value[x] + sigma(dp[y]), sigma(sum[y]))</code>, where <code>y</code> is a direct child of <code>x</code>.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Dynamic Programming, Tree, Depth-First Search).
