 * <b>#808 - Soup Servings</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Math, Dynamic Programming, Probability and Statistics</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You have two soups, A and B, each starting with n mL. On every turn, one of the following four serving operations is chosen at random, each with probability 0.25 independent of all previous turns:
 *
 *
 * pour 100 mL from type A and 0 mL from type B
 *
 * pour 75 mL from type A and 25 mL from type B
 *
 * pour 50 mL from type A and 50 mL from type B
 *
 * pour 25 mL from type A and 75 mL from type B
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *
 * There is no operation that pours 0 mL from A and 100 mL from B.
 *
 * The amounts from A and B are poured simultaneously during the turn.
 *
 * If an operation asks you to pour more than you have left of a soup, pour all that remains of that soup.
 *
 * The process stops immediately after any turn in which one of the soups is used up.
 *
 *
 * Return the probability that A is used up before B, plus half the probability that both soups are used up in the same turn. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 50
 * Output: 0.62500
 * Explanation: 
 * If we perform either of the first two serving operations, soup A will become empty first.
 * If we perform the third operation, A and B will become empty at the same time.
 * If we perform the fourth operation, B will become empty first.
 * So the total probability of A becoming empty first plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time, is 0.25 * (1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0) = 0.625.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 100
 * Output: 0.71875
 * Explanation: 
 * If we perform the first serving operation, soup A will become empty first.
 * If we perform the second serving operations, A will become empty on performing operation [1, 2, 3], and both A and B become empty on performing operation 4.
 * If we perform the third operation, A will become empty on performing operation [1, 2], and both A and B become empty on performing operation 3.
 * If we perform the fourth operation, A will become empty on performing operation 1, and both A and B become empty on performing operation 2.
 * So the total probability of A becoming empty first plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time, is 0.71875.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 0 &lt;= n &lt;= 109
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: For large <code>n</code>, the answer approaches a constant value.
 * Hint 2: Which soup is more likely to deplete first if we are allowed to perform many operations without bias?
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Math, Dynamic Programming, Probability and Statistics).
 * Start brute-force, then optimise: sorting, hashing, two pointers,
 * sliding window, binary search, backtracking, DP, or graph traversal.
 *
 * <h2>Complexity</h2>
 * Time: see implementation  |  Space: see implementation
