 * <b>#2787 - Ways to Express an Integer as Sum of Powers</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Dynamic Programming</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * Given two positive integers n and x.
 *
 *
 * Return the number of ways n can be expressed as the sum of the xth power of unique positive integers, in other words, the number of sets of unique integers [n1, n2, ..., nk] where n = n1x + n2x + ... + nkx.
 *
 *
 * Since the result can be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 *
 *
 * For example, if n = 160 and x = 3, one way to express n is n = 23 + 33 + 53.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 10, x = 2
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: We can express n as the following: n = 32 + 12 = 10.
 * It can be shown that it is the only way to express 10 as the sum of the 2nd power of unique integers.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 4, x = 1
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: We can express n in the following ways:
 * - n = 41 = 4.
 * - n = 31 + 11 = 4.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 300
 *
 * 1 &lt;= x &lt;= 5
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: You can use dynamic programming, where dp[k][j] represents the number of ways to express k as the sum of the x-th power of unique positive integers such that the biggest possible number we use is j.
 * Hint 2: To calculate dp[k][j], you can iterate over the numbers smaller than j and try to use each one as a power of x to make our sum k.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Dynamic Programming).
