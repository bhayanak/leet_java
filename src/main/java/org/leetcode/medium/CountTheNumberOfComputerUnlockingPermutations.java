 * <b>#3577 - Count the Number of Computer Unlocking Permutations</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Math, Brainteaser, Combinatorics</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given an array complexity of length n.
 *
 *
 * There are n locked computers in a room with labels from 0 to n - 1, each with its own unique password. The password of the computer i has a complexity complexity[i].
 *
 *
 * The password for the computer labeled 0 is already decrypted and serves as the root. All other computers must be unlocked using it or another previously unlocked computer, following this information:
 *
 *
 * You can decrypt the password for the computer i using the password for computer j, where j is any integer less than i with a lower complexity. (i.e. j &lt; i and complexity[j] &lt; complexity[i])
 *
 * To decrypt the password for computer i, you must have already unlocked a computer j such that j &lt; i and complexity[j] &lt; complexity[i].
 *
 * Find the number of permutations of [0, 1, 2, ..., (n - 1)] that represent a valid order in which the computers can be unlocked, starting from computer 0 as the only initially unlocked one.
 *
 *
 * Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 *
 *
 * Note that the password for the computer with label 0 is decrypted, and not the computer with the first position in the permutation.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: complexity = [1,2,3]
 *
 *
 * Output: 2
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * The valid permutations are:
 *
 *
 * [0, 1, 2]
 *
 *
 *
 * Unlock computer 0 first with root password.
 *
 * Unlock computer 1 with password of computer 0 since complexity[0] &lt; complexity[1].
 *
 * Unlock computer 2 with password of computer 1 since complexity[1] &lt; complexity[2].
 *
 *
 *
 * [0, 2, 1]
 *
 *
 *
 * Unlock computer 0 first with root password.
 *
 * Unlock computer 2 with password of computer 0 since complexity[0] &lt; complexity[2].
 *
 * Unlock computer 1 with password of computer 0 since complexity[0] &lt; complexity[1].
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: complexity = [3,3,3,4,4,4]
 *
 *
 * Output: 0
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * There are no possible permutations which can unlock all computers.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 2 &lt;= complexity.length &lt;= 105
 *
 * 1 &lt;= complexity[i] &lt;= 109
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Ensure that the element at index 0 has the unique minimum complexity (no other element can match its value).
 * Hint 2: Fix index 0 as the first in the unlocking order.
 * Hint 3: The remaining indices from <code>1</code> to <code>n - 1</code> can then be arranged arbitrarily, yielding <code>factorial(n - 1)</code> possible orders.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Math, Brainteaser, Combinatorics).
