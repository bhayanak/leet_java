 * <b>#2982 - Find Longest Special Substring That Occurs Thrice II</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Hash Table, String, Binary Search, Sliding Window, Counting</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given a string s that consists of lowercase English letters.
 *
 *
 * A string is called special if it is made up of only a single character. For example, the string "abc" is not special, whereas the strings "ddd", "zz", and "f" are special.
 *
 *
 * Return the length of the longest special substring of s which occurs at least thrice, or -1 if no special substring occurs at least thrice.
 *
 *
 * A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "aaaa"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The longest special substring which occurs thrice is "aa": substrings "aaaa", "aaaa", and "aaaa".
 * It can be shown that the maximum length achievable is 2.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "abcdef"
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: There exists no special substring which occurs at least thrice. Hence return -1.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: s = "abcaba"
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The longest special substring which occurs thrice is "a": substrings "abcaba", "abcaba", and "abcaba".
 * It can be shown that the maximum length achievable is 1.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 3 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 5 * 105
 *
 * s consists of only lowercase English letters.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Let <code>len[i]</code> be the length of the longest special string ending with <code>s[i]</code>.
 * Hint 2: If <code>i &gt; 0</code> and <code>s[i] == s[i - 1]</code>, <code>len[i] = len[i - 1] + 1</code>. Otherwise <code>len[i] == 1</code>.
 * Hint 3: Group all the <code>len[i]</code> by <code>s[i]</code>. We have at most <code>26</code> groups.
 * Hint 4: The maximum value of the third largest <code>len[i]</code> in each group is the answer.
 * Hint 5: We only need to maintain the top three values for each group. You can use sorting, heap, or brute-force comparison to find the third largest value in each group.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Hash Table, String, Binary Search, Sliding Window, Counting).
