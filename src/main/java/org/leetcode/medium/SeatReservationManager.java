 * <b>#1845 - Seat Reservation Manager</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Design, Heap (Priority Queue)</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * Design a system that manages the reservation state of n seats that are numbered from 1 to n.
 *
 *
 * Implement the SeatManager class:
 *
 *
 * SeatManager(int n) Initializes a SeatManager object that will manage n seats numbered from 1 to n. All seats are initially available.
 *
 * int reserve() Fetches the smallest-numbered unreserved seat, reserves it, and returns its number.
 *
 * void unreserve(int seatNumber) Unreserves the seat with the given seatNumber.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input
 * ["SeatManager", "reserve", "reserve", "unreserve", "reserve", "reserve", "reserve", "reserve", "unreserve"]
 * [[5], [], [], [2], [], [], [], [], [5]]
 * Output
 * [null, 1, 2, null, 2, 3, 4, 5, null]
 *
 * Explanation
 * SeatManager seatManager = new SeatManager(5); // Initializes a SeatManager with 5 seats.
 * seatManager.reserve();    // All seats are available, so return the lowest numbered seat, which is 1.
 * seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [2,3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 2.
 * seatManager.unreserve(2); // Unreserve seat 2, so now the available seats are [2,3,4,5].
 * seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [2,3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 2.
 * seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 3.
 * seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 4.
 * seatManager.reserve();    // The only available seat is seat 5, so return 5.
 * seatManager.unreserve(5); // Unreserve seat 5, so now the available seats are [5].
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 105
 *
 * 1 &lt;= seatNumber &lt;= n
 *
 * For each call to reserve, it is guaranteed that there will be at least one unreserved seat.
 *
 * For each call to unreserve, it is guaranteed that seatNumber will be reserved.
 *
 * At most 105 calls in total will be made to reserve and unreserve.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: You need a data structure that maintains the states of the seats. This data structure should also allow you to get the first available seat and flip the state of a seat in a reasonable time.
 * Hint 2: You can let the data structure contain the available seats. Then you want to be able to get the lowest element and erase an element, in a reasonable time.
 * Hint 3: Ordered sets support these operations.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Design, Heap (Priority Queue)).
 * Start brute-force, then optimise: sorting, hashing, two pointers,
 * sliding window, binary search, backtracking, DP, or graph traversal.
 *
 * <h2>Complexity</h2>
 * Time: see implementation  |  Space: see implementation
