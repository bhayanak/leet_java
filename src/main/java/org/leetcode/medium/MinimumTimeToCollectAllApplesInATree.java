 * <b>#1443 - Minimum Time to Collect All Apples in a Tree</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Hash Table, Tree, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * Given an undirected tree consisting of n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1, which has some apples in their vertices. You spend 1 second to walk over one edge of the tree. Return the minimum time in seconds you have to spend to collect all apples in the tree, starting at vertex 0 and coming back to this vertex.
 *
 *
 * The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array edges, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] means that exists an edge connecting the vertices ai and bi. Additionally, there is a boolean array hasApple, where hasApple[i] = true means that vertex i has an apple; otherwise, it does not have any apple.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,true,false,true,true,false]
 * Output: 8 
 * Explanation: The figure above represents the given tree where red vertices have an apple. One optimal path to collect all apples is shown by the green arrows.  
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,true,false,false,true,false]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The figure above represents the given tree where red vertices have an apple. One optimal path to collect all apples is shown by the green arrows.  
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,false,false,false,false,false]
 * Output: 0
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 105
 *
 * edges.length == n - 1
 *
 * edges[i].length == 2
 *
 * 0 &lt;= ai &lt; bi &lt;= n - 1
 *
 * hasApple.length == n
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Note that if a node u contains an apple then all edges in the path from the root to the node u have to be used forward and backward (2 times).
 * Hint 2: Therefore use a depth-first search (DFS) to check if an edge will be used or not.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Hash Table, Tree, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search).
 * Start brute-force, then optimise: sorting, hashing, two pointers,
 * sliding window, binary search, backtracking, DP, or graph traversal.
 *
 * <h2>Complexity</h2>
 * Time: see implementation  |  Space: see implementation
