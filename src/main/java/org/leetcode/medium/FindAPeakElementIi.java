 * <b>#1901 - Find a Peak Element II</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Binary Search, Matrix</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * A peak element in a 2D grid is an element that is strictly greater than all of its adjacent neighbors to the left, right, top, and bottom.
 *
 *
 * Given a 0-indexed m x n matrix mat where no two adjacent cells are equal, find any peak element mat[i][j] and return the length 2 array [i,j].
 *
 *
 * You may assume that the entire matrix is surrounded by an outer perimeter with the value -1 in each cell.
 *
 *
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in O(m log(n)) or O(n log(m)) time.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: mat = [[1,4],[3,2]]
 * Output: [0,1]
 * Explanation: Both 3 and 4 are peak elements so [1,0] and [0,1] are both acceptable answers.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: mat = [[10,20,15],[21,30,14],[7,16,32]]
 * Output: [1,1]
 * Explanation: Both 30 and 32 are peak elements so [1,1] and [2,2] are both acceptable answers.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * m == mat.length
 *
 * n == mat[i].length
 *
 * 1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 500
 *
 * 1 &lt;= mat[i][j] &lt;= 105
 *
 * No two adjacent cells are equal.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Let's assume that the width of the array is bigger than the height, otherwise, we will split in another direction.
 * Hint 2: Split the array into three parts: central column left side and right side.
 * Hint 3: Go through the central column and two neighbor columns and look for maximum.
 * Hint 4: If it's in the central column - this is our peak.
 * Hint 5: If it's on the left side, run this algorithm on subarray left_side + central_column.
 * Hint 6: If it's on the right side, run this algorithm on subarray right_side + central_column
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Binary Search, Matrix).
 * Start brute-force, then optimise: sorting, hashing, two pointers,
 * sliding window, binary search, backtracking, DP, or graph traversal.
 *
 * <h2>Complexity</h2>
 * Time: see implementation  |  Space: see implementation
