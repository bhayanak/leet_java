/**
 * <b>#1839 - Longest Substring Of All Vowels in Order</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> String, Sliding Window</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * A string is considered beautiful if it satisfies the following conditions:
 *
 *
 * Each of the 5 English vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') must appear at least once in it.
 *
 * The letters must be sorted in alphabetical order (i.e. all 'a's before 'e's, all 'e's before 'i's, etc.).
 *
 * For example, strings "aeiou" and "aaaaaaeiiiioou" are considered beautiful, but "uaeio", "aeoiu", and "aaaeeeooo" are not beautiful.
 *
 *
 * Given a string word consisting of English vowels, return the length of the longest beautiful substring of word. If no such substring exists, return 0.
 *
 *
 * A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: word = "aeiaaioaaaaeiiiiouuuooaauuaeiu"
 * Output: 13
 * Explanation: The longest beautiful substring in word is "aaaaeiiiiouuu" of length 13.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: word = "aeeeiiiioooauuuaeiou"
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The longest beautiful substring in word is "aeiou" of length 5.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: word = "a"
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: There is no beautiful substring, so return 0.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= word.length &lt;= 5 * 105
 *
 * word consists of characters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Start from each 'a' and find the longest beautiful substring starting at that index.
 * Hint 2: Based on the current character decide if you should include the next character in the beautiful substring.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (String, Sliding Window).
 * Start brute-force, then optimise: sorting, hashing, two pointers,
 * sliding window, binary search, backtracking, DP, or graph traversal.
 *
 * <h2>Complexity</h2>
 * Time: see implementation  |  Space: see implementation
