/**
 * <b>#2125 - Number of Laser Beams in a Bank</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Math, String, Matrix</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * Anti-theft security devices are activated inside a bank. You are given a 0-indexed binary string array bank representing the floor plan of the bank, which is an m x n 2D matrix. bank[i] represents the ith row, consisting of '0's and '1's. '0' means the cell is empty, while'1' means the cell has a security device.
 *
 *
 * There is one laser beam between any two security devices if both conditions are met:
 *
 *
 * The two devices are located on two different rows: r1 and r2, where r1 &lt; r2.
 *
 * For each row i where r1 &lt; i &lt; r2, there are no security devices in the ith row.
 *
 * Laser beams are independent, i.e., one beam does not interfere nor join with another.
 *
 *
 * Return the total number of laser beams in the bank.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: bank = ["011001","000000","010100","001000"]
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation: Between each of the following device pairs, there is one beam. In total, there are 8 beams:
 *  * bank[0][1] -- bank[2][1]
 *  * bank[0][1] -- bank[2][3]
 *  * bank[0][2] -- bank[2][1]
 *  * bank[0][2] -- bank[2][3]
 *  * bank[0][5] -- bank[2][1]
 *  * bank[0][5] -- bank[2][3]
 *  * bank[2][1] -- bank[3][2]
 *  * bank[2][3] -- bank[3][2]
 * Note that there is no beam between any device on the 0th row with any on the 3rd row.
 * This is because the 2nd row contains security devices, which breaks the second condition.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: bank = ["000","111","000"]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: There does not exist two devices located on two different rows.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * m == bank.length
 *
 * n == bank[i].length
 *
 * 1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 500
 *
 * bank[i][j] is either '0' or '1'.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: What is the commonality between security devices on the same row?
 * Hint 2: Each device on the same row has the same number of beams pointing towards the devices on the next row with devices.
 * Hint 3: If you were given an integer array where each element is the number of security devices on each row, can you solve it?
 * Hint 4: Convert the input to such an array, skip any row with no security device, then find the sum of the product between adjacent elements.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Math, String, Matrix).
