/**
 * <b>#3854 - Minimum Operations to Make Array Parity Alternating</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> General</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given an integer array nums.
 *
 *
 * An array is called parity alternating if for every index i where 0 &lt;= i &lt; n - 1, nums[i] and nums[i + 1] have different parity (one is even and the other is odd).
 *
 *
 * In one operation, you may choose any index i and either increase nums[i] by 1 or decrease nums[i] by 1.
 *
 *
 * Return an integer array answer of length 2 where:
 *
 *
 * answer[0] is the minimum number of operations required to make the array parity alternating.
 *
 * answer[1] is the minimum possible value of max(nums) - min(nums) taken over all arrays that are parity alternating and can be obtained by performing exactly answer[0] operations.
 *
 * An array of length 1 is considered parity alternating.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [-2,-3,1,4]
 *
 *
 * Output: [2,6]
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * Applying the following operations:
 *
 *
 * Increase nums[2] by 1, resulting in nums = [-2, -3, 2, 4].
 *
 * Decrease nums[3] by 1, resulting in nums = [-2, -3, 2, 3].
 *
 * The resulting array is parity alternating, and the value of max(nums) - min(nums) = 3 - (-3) = 6 is the minimum possible among all parity alternating arrays obtainable using exactly 2 operations.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [0,2,-2]
 *
 *
 * Output: [1,3]
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * Applying the following operation:
 *
 *
 * Decrease nums[1] by 1, resulting in nums = [0, 1, -2].
 *
 * The resulting array is parity alternating, and the value of max(nums) - min(nums) = 1 - (-2) = 3 is the minimum possible among all parity alternating arrays obtainable using exactly 1 operation.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: nums = [7]
 *
 *
 * Output: [0,0]
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * No operations are required. The array is already parity alternating, and the value of max(nums) - min(nums) = 7 - 7 = 0, which is the minimum possible.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 105
 *
 * -109 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 109
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: A parity alternating array must follow one of two patterns: <code>even, odd, even, ...</code> or <code>odd, even, odd, ...</code>.
 * Hint 2: If a position has the wrong parity, its value must be changed by exactly <code>+/-1</code> (one operation) to fix the parity.
 * Hint 3: For each pattern, count the minimum operations needed to make all positions match the required parity.
 * Hint 4: Among patterns with minimum operations, choose adjustments that minimize <code>max(nums) - min(nums)</code> while preserving parity.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (General).
