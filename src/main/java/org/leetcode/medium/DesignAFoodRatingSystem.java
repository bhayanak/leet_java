 * <b>#2353 - Design a Food Rating System</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Hash Table, String, Design, Heap (Priority Queue), Ordered Set</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * Design a food rating system that can do the following:
 *
 *
 * Modify the rating of a food item listed in the system.
 *
 * Return the highest-rated food item for a type of cuisine in the system.
 *
 * Implement the FoodRatings class:
 *
 *
 * FoodRatings(String[] foods, String[] cuisines, int[] ratings) Initializes the system. The food items are described by foods, cuisines and ratings, all of which have a length of n.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * foods[i] is the name of the ith food,
 *
 * cuisines[i] is the type of cuisine of the ith food, and
 *
 * ratings[i] is the initial rating of the ith food.
 *
 *
 *
 * void changeRating(String food, int newRating) Changes the rating of the food item with the name food.
 *
 * String highestRated(String cuisine) Returns the name of the food item that has the highest rating for the given type of cuisine. If there is a tie, return the item with the lexicographically smaller name.
 *
 * Note that a string x is lexicographically smaller than string y if x comes before y in dictionary order, that is, either x is a prefix of y, or if i is the first position such that x[i] != y[i], then x[i] comes before y[i] in alphabetic order.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input
 * ["FoodRatings", "highestRated", "highestRated", "changeRating", "highestRated", "changeRating", "highestRated"]
 * [[["kimchi", "miso", "sushi", "moussaka", "ramen", "bulgogi"], ["korean", "japanese", "japanese", "greek", "japanese", "korean"], [9, 12, 8, 15, 14, 7]], ["korean"], ["japanese"], ["sushi", 16], ["japanese"], ["ramen", 16], ["japanese"]]
 * Output
 * [null, "kimchi", "ramen", null, "sushi", null, "ramen"]
 *
 * Explanation
 * FoodRatings foodRatings = new FoodRatings(["kimchi", "miso", "sushi", "moussaka", "ramen", "bulgogi"], ["korean", "japanese", "japanese", "greek", "japanese", "korean"], [9, 12, 8, 15, 14, 7]);
 * foodRatings.highestRated("korean"); // return "kimchi"
 *                                     // "kimchi" is the highest rated korean food with a rating of 9.
 * foodRatings.highestRated("japanese"); // return "ramen"
 *                                       // "ramen" is the highest rated japanese food with a rating of 14.
 * foodRatings.changeRating("sushi", 16); // "sushi" now has a rating of 16.
 * foodRatings.highestRated("japanese"); // return "sushi"
 *                                       // "sushi" is the highest rated japanese food with a rating of 16.
 * foodRatings.changeRating("ramen", 16); // "ramen" now has a rating of 16.
 * foodRatings.highestRated("japanese"); // return "ramen"
 *                                       // Both "sushi" and "ramen" have a rating of 16.
 *                                       // However, "ramen" is lexicographically smaller than "sushi".
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 2 * 104
 *
 * n == foods.length == cuisines.length == ratings.length
 *
 * 1 &lt;= foods[i].length, cuisines[i].length &lt;= 10
 *
 * foods[i], cuisines[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
 *
 * 1 &lt;= ratings[i] &lt;= 108
 *
 * All the strings in foods are distinct.
 *
 * food will be the name of a food item in the system across all calls to changeRating.
 *
 * cuisine will be a type of cuisine of at least one food item in the system across all calls to highestRated.
 *
 * At most 2 * 104 calls in total will be made to changeRating and highestRated.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: The key to solving this problem is to properly store the data using the right data structures.
 * Hint 2: Firstly, a hash table is needed to efficiently map each food item to its cuisine and current rating.
 * Hint 3: In addition, another hash table is needed to map cuisines to foods within each cuisine stored in an ordered set according to their ratings.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Hash Table, String, Design, Heap (Priority Queue), Ordered Set).
