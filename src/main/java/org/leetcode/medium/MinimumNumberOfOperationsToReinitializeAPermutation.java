/**
 * <b>#1806 - Minimum Number of Operations to Reinitialize a Permutation</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Math, Simulation</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given an even integer n​​​​​​. You initially have a permutation perm of size n​​ where perm[i] == i​ (0-indexed)​​​​.
 *
 *
 * In one operation, you will create a new array arr, and for each i:
 *
 *
 * If i % 2 == 0, then arr[i] = perm[i / 2].
 *
 * If i % 2 == 1, then arr[i] = perm[n / 2 + (i - 1) / 2].
 *
 * You will then assign arr​​​​ to perm.
 *
 *
 * Return the minimum non-zero number of operations you need to perform on perm to return the permutation to its initial value.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 2
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: perm = [0,1] initially.
 * After the 1st operation, perm = [0,1]
 * So it takes only 1 operation.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 4
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: perm = [0,1,2,3] initially.
 * After the 1st operation, perm = [0,2,1,3]
 * After the 2nd operation, perm = [0,1,2,3]
 * So it takes only 2 operations.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: n = 6
 * Output: 4
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 2 &lt;= n &lt;= 1000
 *
 * n​​​​​​ is even.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: It is safe to assume the number of  operations isn't more than n
 * Hint 2: The number is small enough to apply a brute force solution.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Math, Simulation).
 * Start brute-force, then optimise: sorting, hashing, two pointers,
 * sliding window, binary search, backtracking, DP, or graph traversal.
 *
 * <h2>Complexity</h2>
 * Time: see implementation  |  Space: see implementation
