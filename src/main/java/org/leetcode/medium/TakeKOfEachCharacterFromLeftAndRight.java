/**
 * <b>#2516 - Take K of Each Character From Left and Right</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Hash Table, String, Sliding Window</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given a string s consisting of the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' and a non-negative integer k. Each minute, you may take either the leftmost character of s, or the rightmost character of s.
 *
 *
 * Return the minimum number of minutes needed for you to take at least k of each character, or return -1 if it is not possible to take k of each character.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "aabaaaacaabc", k = 2
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation: 
 * Take three characters from the left of s. You now have two 'a' characters, and one 'b' character.
 * Take five characters from the right of s. You now have four 'a' characters, two 'b' characters, and two 'c' characters.
 * A total of 3 + 5 = 8 minutes is needed.
 * It can be proven that 8 is the minimum number of minutes needed.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "a", k = 1
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: It is not possible to take one 'b' or 'c' so return -1.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 105
 *
 * s consists of only the letters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
 *
 * 0 &lt;= k &lt;= s.length
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Start by counting the frequency of each character and checking if it is possible.
 * Hint 2: If you take x characters from the left side, what is the minimum number of characters you need to take from the right side? Find this for all values of x in the range 0 ≤ x ≤ s.length.
 * Hint 3: Use a two-pointers approach to avoid computing the same information multiple times.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Hash Table, String, Sliding Window).
