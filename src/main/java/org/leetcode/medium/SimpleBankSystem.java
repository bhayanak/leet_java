 * <b>#2043 - Simple Bank System</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Hash Table, Design, Simulation</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You have been tasked with writing a program for a popular bank that will automate all its incoming transactions (transfer, deposit, and withdraw). The bank has n accounts numbered from 1 to n. The initial balance of each account is stored in a 0-indexed integer array balance, with the (i + 1)th account having an initial balance of balance[i].
 *
 *
 * Execute all the valid transactions. A transaction is valid if:
 *
 *
 * The given account number(s) are between 1 and n, and
 *
 * The amount of money withdrawn or transferred from is less than or equal to the balance of the account.
 *
 * Implement the Bank class:
 *
 *
 * Bank(long[] balance) Initializes the object with the 0-indexed integer array balance.
 *
 * boolean transfer(int account1, int account2, long money) Transfers money dollars from the account numbered account1 to the account numbered account2. Return true if the transaction was successful, false otherwise.
 *
 * boolean deposit(int account, long money) Deposit money dollars into the account numbered account. Return true if the transaction was successful, false otherwise.
 *
 * boolean withdraw(int account, long money) Withdraw money dollars from the account numbered account. Return true if the transaction was successful, false otherwise.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input
 * ["Bank", "withdraw", "transfer", "deposit", "transfer", "withdraw"]
 * [[[10, 100, 20, 50, 30]], [3, 10], [5, 1, 20], [5, 20], [3, 4, 15], [10, 50]]
 * Output
 * [null, true, true, true, false, false]
 *
 * Explanation
 * Bank bank = new Bank([10, 100, 20, 50, 30]);
 * bank.withdraw(3, 10);    // return true, account 3 has a balance of $20, so it is valid to withdraw $10.
 *                          // Account 3 has $20 - $10 = $10.
 * bank.transfer(5, 1, 20); // return true, account 5 has a balance of $30, so it is valid to transfer $20.
 *                          // Account 5 has $30 - $20 = $10, and account 1 has $10 + $20 = $30.
 * bank.deposit(5, 20);     // return true, it is valid to deposit $20 to account 5.
 *                          // Account 5 has $10 + $20 = $30.
 * bank.transfer(3, 4, 15); // return false, the current balance of account 3 is $10,
 *                          // so it is invalid to transfer $15 from it.
 * bank.withdraw(10, 50);   // return false, it is invalid because account 10 does not exist.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * n == balance.length
 *
 * 1 &lt;= n, account, account1, account2 &lt;= 105
 *
 * 0 &lt;= balance[i], money &lt;= 1012
 *
 * At most 104 calls will be made to each function transfer, deposit, withdraw.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: How do you determine if a transaction will fail?
 * Hint 2: Simply apply the operations if the transaction is valid.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Hash Table, Design, Simulation).
