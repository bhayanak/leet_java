/**
 * <b>#2212 - Maximum Points in an Archery Competition</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Backtracking, Bit Manipulation, Enumeration</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * Alice and Bob are opponents in an archery competition. The competition has set the following rules:
 *
 *
 * Alice first shoots numArrows arrows and then Bob shoots numArrows arrows.
 *
 * The points are then calculated as follows:
 *
 *
 *
 * The target has integer scoring sections ranging from 0 to 11 inclusive.
 *
 * For each section of the target with score k (in between 0 to 11), say Alice and Bob have shot ak and bk arrows on that section respectively. If ak &gt;= bk, then Alice takes k points. If ak &lt; bk, then Bob takes k points.
 *
 * However, if ak == bk == 0, then nobody takes k points.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * For example, if Alice and Bob both shot 2 arrows on the section with score 11, then Alice takes 11 points. On the other hand, if Alice shot 0 arrows on the section with score 11 and Bob shot 2 arrows on that same section, then Bob takes 11 points.
 *
 *
 * You are given the integer numArrows and an integer array aliceArrows of size 12, which represents the number of arrows Alice shot on each scoring section from 0 to 11. Now, Bob wants to maximize the total number of points he can obtain.
 *
 *
 * Return the array bobArrows which represents the number of arrows Bob shot on each scoring section from 0 to 11. The sum of the values in bobArrows should equal numArrows.
 *
 *
 * If there are multiple ways for Bob to earn the maximum total points, return any one of them.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: numArrows = 9, aliceArrows = [1,1,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,1,2,0]
 * Output: [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,2,3,1]
 * Explanation: The table above shows how the competition is scored. 
 * Bob earns a total point of 4 + 5 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 47.
 * It can be shown that Bob cannot obtain a score higher than 47 points.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: numArrows = 3, aliceArrows = [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]
 * Output: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0]
 * Explanation: The table above shows how the competition is scored.
 * Bob earns a total point of 8 + 9 + 10 = 27.
 * It can be shown that Bob cannot obtain a score higher than 27 points.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= numArrows &lt;= 105
 *
 * aliceArrows.length == bobArrows.length == 12
 *
 * 0 &lt;= aliceArrows[i], bobArrows[i] &lt;= numArrows
 *
 * sum(aliceArrows[i]) == numArrows
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: To obtain points for some certain section x, what is the minimum number of arrows Bob must shoot?
 * Hint 2: Given the small number of sections, can we brute force which sections Bob wants to win?
 * Hint 3: For every set of sections Bob wants to win, check if we have the required amount of arrows. If we do, it is a valid selection.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Backtracking, Bit Manipulation, Enumeration).
