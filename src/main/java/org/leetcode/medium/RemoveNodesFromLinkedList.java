/**
 * <b>#2487 - Remove Nodes From Linked List</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Linked List, Stack, Recursion, Monotonic Stack</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given the head of a linked list.
 *
 *
 * Remove every node which has a node with a greater value anywhere to the right side of it.
 *
 *
 * Return the head of the modified linked list.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: head = [5,2,13,3,8]
 * Output: [13,8]
 * Explanation: The nodes that should be removed are 5, 2 and 3.
 * - Node 13 is to the right of node 5.
 * - Node 13 is to the right of node 2.
 * - Node 8 is to the right of node 3.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: head = [1,1,1,1]
 * Output: [1,1,1,1]
 * Explanation: Every node has value 1, so no nodes are removed.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range [1, 105].
 *
 * 1 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 105
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Iterate on nodes in reversed order.
 * Hint 2: When iterating in reversed order, save the maximum value that was passed before.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Linked List, Stack, Recursion, Monotonic Stack).
