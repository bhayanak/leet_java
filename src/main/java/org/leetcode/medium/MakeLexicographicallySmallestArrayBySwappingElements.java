 * <b>#2948 - Make Lexicographically Smallest Array by Swapping Elements</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Union-Find, Sorting</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers nums and a positive integer limit.
 *
 *
 * In one operation, you can choose any two indices i and j and swap nums[i] and nums[j] if |nums[i] - nums[j]| &lt;= limit.
 *
 *
 * Return the lexicographically smallest array that can be obtained by performing the operation any number of times.
 *
 *
 * An array a is lexicographically smaller than an array b if in the first position where a and b differ, array a has an element that is less than the corresponding element in b. For example, the array [2,10,3] is lexicographically smaller than the array [10,2,3] because they differ at index 0 and 2 &lt; 10.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,5,3,9,8], limit = 2
 * Output: [1,3,5,8,9]
 * Explanation: Apply the operation 2 times:
 * - Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. The array becomes [1,3,5,9,8]
 * - Swap nums[3] with nums[4]. The array becomes [1,3,5,8,9]
 * We cannot obtain a lexicographically smaller array by applying any more operations.
 * Note that it may be possible to get the same result by doing different operations.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,7,6,18,2,1], limit = 3
 * Output: [1,6,7,18,1,2]
 * Explanation: Apply the operation 3 times:
 * - Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. The array becomes [1,6,7,18,2,1]
 * - Swap nums[0] with nums[4]. The array becomes [2,6,7,18,1,1]
 * - Swap nums[0] with nums[5]. The array becomes [1,6,7,18,1,2]
 * We cannot obtain a lexicographically smaller array by applying any more operations.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,7,28,19,10], limit = 3
 * Output: [1,7,28,19,10]
 * Explanation: [1,7,28,19,10] is the lexicographically smallest array we can obtain because we cannot apply the operation on any two indices.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 105
 *
 * 1 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 109
 *
 * 1 &lt;= limit &lt;= 109
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Construct a virtual graph where all elements in <code>nums</code> are nodes and the pairs satisfying the condition have an edge between them.
 * Hint 2: Instead of constructing all edges, we only care about the connected components.
 * Hint 3: Can we use DSU?
 * Hint 4: Sort <code>nums</code>. Now we just need to consider if the consecutive elements have an edge to check if they belong to the same connected component. Hence, all connected components become a list of position-consecutive elements after sorting.
 * Hint 5: For each index of <code>nums</code> from <code>0</code> to <code>nums.length - 1</code> we can change it to the current minimum value we have in its connected component and remove that value from the connected component.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Union-Find, Sorting).
