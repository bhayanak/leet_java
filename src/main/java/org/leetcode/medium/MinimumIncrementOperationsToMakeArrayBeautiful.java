 * <b>#2919 - Minimum Increment Operations to Make Array Beautiful</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Dynamic Programming</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums having length n, and an integer k.
 *
 *
 * You can perform the following increment operation any number of times (including zero):
 *
 *
 * Choose an index i in the range [0, n - 1], and increase nums[i] by 1.
 *
 * An array is considered beautiful if, for any subarray with a size of 3 or more, its maximum element is greater than or equal to k.
 *
 *
 * Return an integer denoting the minimum number of increment operations needed to make nums beautiful.
 *
 *
 * A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [2,3,0,0,2], k = 4
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: We can perform the following increment operations to make nums beautiful:
 * Choose index i = 1 and increase nums[1] by 1 -&gt; [2,4,0,0,2].
 * Choose index i = 4 and increase nums[4] by 1 -&gt; [2,4,0,0,3].
 * Choose index i = 4 and increase nums[4] by 1 -&gt; [2,4,0,0,4].
 * The subarrays with a size of 3 or more are: [2,4,0], [4,0,0], [0,0,4], [2,4,0,0], [4,0,0,4], [2,4,0,0,4].
 * In all the subarrays, the maximum element is equal to k = 4, so nums is now beautiful.
 * It can be shown that nums cannot be made beautiful with fewer than 3 increment operations.
 * Hence, the answer is 3.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [0,1,3,3], k = 5
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: We can perform the following increment operations to make nums beautiful:
 * Choose index i = 2 and increase nums[2] by 1 -&gt; [0,1,4,3].
 * Choose index i = 2 and increase nums[2] by 1 -&gt; [0,1,5,3].
 * The subarrays with a size of 3 or more are: [0,1,5], [1,5,3], [0,1,5,3].
 * In all the subarrays, the maximum element is equal to k = 5, so nums is now beautiful.
 * It can be shown that nums cannot be made beautiful with fewer than 2 increment operations.
 * Hence, the answer is 2.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,1,2], k = 1
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: The only subarray with a size of 3 or more in this example is [1,1,2].
 * The maximum element, 2, is already greater than k = 1, so we don't need any increment operation.
 * Hence, the answer is 0.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 3 &lt;= n == nums.length &lt;= 105
 *
 * 0 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 109
 *
 * 0 &lt;= k &lt;= 109
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: There needs to be at least one value among <code>3</code> consecutive values in the array that is greater than or equal to <code>k</code>.
 * Hint 2: The problem can be solved using dynamic programming.
 * Hint 3: Let <code>dp[i]</code> be the minimum number of increment operations required to make the subarray consisting of the first <code>i</code> values beautiful, while also having the value at <code>nums[i] &gt;= k</code>.
 * Hint 4: <code>dp[0] = max(0, k - nums[0])</code>, <code>dp[1] = max(0, k - nums[1])</code>, and <code>dp[2] = max(0, k - nums[2])</code>.
 * Hint 5: <code>dp[i] = max(0, k - nums[i]) + min(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2], dp[i - 3])</code> for <code>i</code> in the range <code>[3, n - 1]</code>.
 * Hint 6: The answer to the problem is <code>min(dp[n - 1], dp[n - 2], dp[n - 3])</code>.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Dynamic Programming).
