    /**
     * LeetCode #752 – Open the Lock
     * Difficulty: MEDIUM
     * Topics: Array, Hash Table, String, Breadth-First Search
     *
     * You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels. Each wheel has 10
     * slots: '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'. The wheels can
     * rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn '9' to be '0', or
     * '0' to be '9'. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.
     * 
     * 
     * The lock initially starts at '0000', a string representing the state of the
     * 4 wheels.
     * 
     * 
     * You are given a list of deadends dead ends, meaning if the lock displays
     * any of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning and you will
     * be unable to open it.
     * 
     * 
     * Given a target representing the value of the wheels that will unlock the
     * lock, return the minimum total number of turns required to open the lock,
     * or -1 if it is impossible.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * Example 1:
     * 
     * Input: deadends = ["0201","0101","0102","1212","2002"], target = "0202"
     * Output: 6
     * Explanation:
     * A sequence of valid moves would be "0000" -&gt; "1000" -&gt; "1100" -&gt; "1200" -&gt;
     * "1201" -&gt; "1202" -&gt; "0202".
     * Note that a sequence like "0000" -&gt; "0001" -&gt; "0002" -&gt; "0102" -&gt; "0202"
     * would be invalid,
     * because the wheels of the lock become stuck after the display becomes the
     * dead end "0102".
     * 
     * Example 2:
     * 
     * Input: deadends = ["8888"], target = "0009"
     * Output: 1
     * Explanation: We can turn the last wheel in reverse to move from "0000" -&gt;
     * "0009".
     * 
     * Example 3:
     * 
     * Input: deadends =
     * ["8887","8889","8878","8898","8788","8988","7888","9888"], target = "8888"
     * Output: -1
     * Explanation: We cannot reach the target without getting stuck.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * Constraints:
     * 
     * 
     * 1 &lt;= deadends.length &lt;= 500
     * 
     * dead
