/**
 * <b>#1630 - Arithmetic Subarrays</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Hash Table, Sorting</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least two elements, and the difference between every two consecutive elements is the same. More formally, a sequence s is arithmetic if and only if s[i+1] - s[i] == s[1] - s[0] for all valid i.
 *
 *
 * For example, these are arithmetic sequences:
 *
 * 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
 * 7, 7, 7, 7
 * 3, -1, -5, -9
 *
 * The following sequence is not arithmetic:
 *
 * 1, 1, 2, 5, 7
 *
 * You are given an array of n integers, nums, and two arrays of m integers each, l and r, representing the m range queries, where the ith query is the range [l[i], r[i]]. All the arrays are 0-indexed.
 *
 *
 * Return a list of boolean elements answer, where answer[i] is true if the subarray nums[l[i]], nums[l[i]+1], ... , nums[r[i]] can be rearranged to form an arithmetic sequence, and false otherwise.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [4,6,5,9,3,7], l = [0,0,2], r = [2,3,5]
 * Output: [true,false,true]
 * Explanation:
 * In the 0th query, the subarray is [4,6,5]. This can be rearranged as [6,5,4], which is an arithmetic sequence.
 * In the 1st query, the subarray is [4,6,5,9]. This cannot be rearranged as an arithmetic sequence.
 * In the 2nd query, the subarray is [5,9,3,7]. This can be rearranged as [3,5,7,9], which is an arithmetic sequence.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [-12,-9,-3,-12,-6,15,20,-25,-20,-15,-10], l = [0,1,6,4,8,7], r = [4,4,9,7,9,10]
 * Output: [false,true,false,false,true,true]
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * n == nums.length
 *
 * m == l.length
 *
 * m == r.length
 *
 * 2 &lt;= n &lt;= 500
 *
 * 1 &lt;= m &lt;= 500
 *
 * 0 &lt;= l[i] &lt; r[i] &lt; n
 *
 * -105 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 105
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: To check if a given sequence is arithmetic, just check that the difference between every two consecutive elements is the same.
 * Hint 2: If and only if a set of numbers can make an arithmetic sequence, then its sorted version makes an arithmetic sequence. So to check a set of numbers, sort it, and check if that sequence is arithmetic.
 * Hint 3: For each query, get the corresponding set of numbers which will be the sub-array represented by the query, sort it, and check if the result sequence is arithmetic.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Hash Table, Sorting).
 * Start brute-force, then optimise: sorting, hashing, two pointers,
 * sliding window, binary search, backtracking, DP, or graph traversal.
 *
 * <h2>Complexity</h2>
 * Time: see implementation  |  Space: see implementation
