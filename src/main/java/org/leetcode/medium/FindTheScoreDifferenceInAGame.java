 * <b>#3847 - Find the Score Difference in a Game</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Simulation</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given an integer array nums, where nums[i] represents the points scored in the ith game.
 *
 *
 * There are exactly two players. Initially, the first player is active and the second player is inactive.
 *
 *
 * The following rules apply sequentially for each game i:
 *
 *
 * If nums[i] is odd, the active and inactive players swap roles.
 *
 * In every 6th game (that is, game indices 5, 11, 17, ...), the active and inactive players swap roles.
 *
 * The active player plays the ith game and gains nums[i] points.
 *
 * Return the score difference, defined as the first player's total score minus the second player's total score.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3]
 *
 *
 * Output: 0
 *
 *
 * Explanation:​​​​​​​
 *
 *
 * Game 0: Since the points are odd, the second player becomes active and gains nums[0] = 1 point.
 *
 * Game 1: No swap occurs. The second player gains nums[1] = 2 points.
 *
 * Game 2: Since the points are odd, the first player becomes active and gains nums[2] = 3 points.
 *
 * The score difference is 3 - 3 = 0.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [2,4,2,1,2,1]
 *
 *
 * Output: 4
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * Games 0 to 2: The first player gains 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 points.
 *
 * Game 3: Since the points are odd, the second player is now active and gains nums[3] = 1 point.
 *
 * Game 4: The second player gains nums[4] = 2 points.
 *
 * Game 5: Since the points are odd, the players swap roles. Then, because this is the 6th game, the players swap again. The second player gains nums[5] = 1 point.
 *
 * The score difference is 8 - 4 = 4.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1]
 *
 *
 * Output: -1
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * Game 0: Since the points are odd, the second player is now active and gains nums[0] = 1 point.
 *
 * The score difference is 0 - 1 = -1.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 1000
 *
 * 1 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 1000
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Simulate as described
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Simulation).
