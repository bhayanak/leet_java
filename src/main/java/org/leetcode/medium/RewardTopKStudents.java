/**
 * <b>#2512 - Reward Top K Students</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Hash Table, String, Sorting, Heap (Priority Queue)</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given two string arrays positive_feedback and negative_feedback, containing the words denoting positive and negative feedback, respectively. Note that no word is both positive and negative.
 *
 *
 * Initially every student has 0 points. Each positive word in a feedback report increases the points of a student by 3, whereas each negative word decreases the points by 1.
 *
 *
 * You are given n feedback reports, represented by a 0-indexed string array report and a 0-indexed integer array student_id, where student_id[i] represents the ID of the student who has received the feedback report report[i]. The ID of each student is unique.
 *
 *
 * Given an integer k, return the top k students after ranking them in non-increasing order by their points. In case more than one student has the same points, the one with the lower ID ranks higher.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: positive_feedback = ["smart","brilliant","studious"], negative_feedback = ["not"], report = ["this student is studious","the student is smart"], student_id = [1,2], k = 2
 * Output: [1,2]
 * Explanation: 
 * Both the students have 1 positive feedback and 3 points but since student 1 has a lower ID he ranks higher.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: positive_feedback = ["smart","brilliant","studious"], negative_feedback = ["not"], report = ["this student is not studious","the student is smart"], student_id = [1,2], k = 2
 * Output: [2,1]
 * Explanation: 
 * - The student with ID 1 has 1 positive feedback and 1 negative feedback, so he has 3-1=2 points. 
 * - The student with ID 2 has 1 positive feedback, so he has 3 points. 
 * Since student 2 has more points, [2,1] is returned.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= positive_feedback.length, negative_feedback.length &lt;= 104
 *
 * 1 &lt;= positive_feedback[i].length, negative_feedback[j].length &lt;= 100
 *
 * Both positive_feedback[i] and negative_feedback[j] consists of lowercase English letters.
 *
 * No word is present in both positive_feedback and negative_feedback.
 *
 * n == report.length == student_id.length
 *
 * 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 104
 *
 * report[i] consists of lowercase English letters and spaces ' '.
 *
 * There is a single space between consecutive words of report[i].
 *
 * 1 &lt;= report[i].length &lt;= 100
 *
 * 1 &lt;= student_id[i] &lt;= 109
 *
 * All the values of student_id[i] are unique.
 *
 * 1 &lt;= k &lt;= n
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Hash the positive and negative feedback words separately.
 * Hint 2: Calculate the points for each student’s feedback.
 * Hint 3: Sort the students accordingly to find the top <em>k</em> among them.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Hash Table, String, Sorting, Heap (Priority Queue)).
