 * <b>#3296 - Minimum Number of Seconds to Make Mountain Height Zero</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Math, Binary Search, Greedy, Heap (Priority Queue)</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given an integer mountainHeight denoting the height of a mountain.
 *
 *
 * You are also given an integer array workerTimes representing the work time of workers in seconds.
 *
 *
 * The workers work simultaneously to reduce the height of the mountain. For worker i:
 *
 *
 * To decrease the mountain's height by x, it takes workerTimes[i] + workerTimes[i] * 2 + ... + workerTimes[i] * x seconds. For example:
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * To reduce the height of the mountain by 1, it takes workerTimes[i] seconds.
 *
 * To reduce the height of the mountain by 2, it takes workerTimes[i] + workerTimes[i] * 2 seconds, and so on.
 *
 *
 *
 * Return an integer representing the minimum number of seconds required for the workers to make the height of the mountain 0.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: mountainHeight = 4, workerTimes = [2,1,1]
 *
 *
 * Output: 3
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * One way the height of the mountain can be reduced to 0 is:
 *
 *
 * Worker 0 reduces the height by 1, taking workerTimes[0] = 2 seconds.
 *
 * Worker 1 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1] * 2 = 3 seconds.
 *
 * Worker 2 reduces the height by 1, taking workerTimes[2] = 1 second.
 *
 * Since they work simultaneously, the minimum time needed is max(2, 3, 1) = 3 seconds.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: mountainHeight = 10, workerTimes = [3,2,2,4]
 *
 *
 * Output: 12
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * Worker 0 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[0] + workerTimes[0] * 2 = 9 seconds.
 *
 * Worker 1 reduces the height by 3, taking workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1] * 2 + workerTimes[1] * 3 = 12 seconds.
 *
 * Worker 2 reduces the height by 3, taking workerTimes[2] + workerTimes[2] * 2 + workerTimes[2] * 3 = 12 seconds.
 *
 * Worker 3 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[3] + workerTimes[3] * 2 = 12 seconds.
 *
 * The number of seconds needed is max(9, 12, 12, 12) = 12 seconds.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: mountainHeight = 5, workerTimes = [1]
 *
 *
 * Output: 15
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * There is only one worker in this example, so the answer is workerTimes[0] + workerTimes[0] * 2 + workerTimes[0] * 3 + workerTimes[0] * 4 + workerTimes[0] * 5 = 15.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= mountainHeight &lt;= 105
 *
 * 1 &lt;= workerTimes.length &lt;= 104
 *
 * 1 &lt;= workerTimes[i] &lt;= 106
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Can we use binary search to solve this problem?
 * Hint 2: Do a binary search on the number of seconds to check if it's enough to reduce the mountain height to 0 or less with all workers working simultaneously.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Math, Binary Search, Greedy, Heap (Priority Queue)).
