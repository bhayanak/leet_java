/**
 * <b>#1942 - The Number of the Smallest Unoccupied Chair</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Hash Table, Heap (Priority Queue)</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * There is a party where n friends numbered from 0 to n - 1 are attending. There is an infinite number of chairs in this party that are numbered from 0 to infinity. When a friend arrives at the party, they sit on the unoccupied chair with the smallest number.
 *
 *
 * For example, if chairs 0, 1, and 5 are occupied when a friend comes, they will sit on chair number 2.
 *
 * When a friend leaves the party, their chair becomes unoccupied at the moment they leave. If another friend arrives at that same moment, they can sit in that chair.
 *
 *
 * You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array times where times[i] = [arrivali, leavingi], indicating the arrival and leaving times of the ith friend respectively, and an integer targetFriend. All arrival times are distinct.
 *
 *
 * Return the chair number that the friend numbered targetFriend will sit on.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: times = [[1,4],[2,3],[4,6]], targetFriend = 1
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: 
 * - Friend 0 arrives at time 1 and sits on chair 0.
 * - Friend 1 arrives at time 2 and sits on chair 1.
 * - Friend 1 leaves at time 3 and chair 1 becomes empty.
 * - Friend 0 leaves at time 4 and chair 0 becomes empty.
 * - Friend 2 arrives at time 4 and sits on chair 0.
 * Since friend 1 sat on chair 1, we return 1.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: times = [[3,10],[1,5],[2,6]], targetFriend = 0
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: 
 * - Friend 1 arrives at time 1 and sits on chair 0.
 * - Friend 2 arrives at time 2 and sits on chair 1.
 * - Friend 0 arrives at time 3 and sits on chair 2.
 * - Friend 1 leaves at time 5 and chair 0 becomes empty.
 * - Friend 2 leaves at time 6 and chair 1 becomes empty.
 * - Friend 0 leaves at time 10 and chair 2 becomes empty.
 * Since friend 0 sat on chair 2, we return 2.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * n == times.length
 *
 * 2 &lt;= n &lt;= 104
 *
 * times[i].length == 2
 *
 * 1 &lt;= arrivali &lt; leavingi &lt;= 105
 *
 * 0 &lt;= targetFriend &lt;= n - 1
 *
 * Each arrivali time is distinct.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Sort times by arrival time.
 * Hint 2: for each arrival_i find the smallest unoccupied chair and mark it as occupied until leaving_i.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Hash Table, Heap (Priority Queue)).
 * Start brute-force, then optimise: sorting, hashing, two pointers,
 * sliding window, binary search, backtracking, DP, or graph traversal.
 *
 * <h2>Complexity</h2>
 * Time: see implementation  |  Space: see implementation
