     * LeetCode #606 – Construct String from Binary Tree
     * Difficulty: MEDIUM
     * Topics: String, Tree, Depth-First Search, Binary Tree
     *
     * Given the root node of a binary tree, your task is to create a string
     * representation of the tree following a specific set of formatting rules.
     * The representation should be based on a preorder traversal of the binary
     * tree and must adhere to the following guidelines:
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * Node Representation: Each node in the tree should be represented by its
     * integer value.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * Parentheses for Children: If a node has at least one child (either left or
     * right), its children should be represented inside parentheses.
     * Specifically:
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * If a node has a left child, the value of the left child should be enclosed
     * in parentheses immediately following the node's value.
     * 
     * If a node has a right child, the value of the right child should also be
     * enclosed in parentheses. The parentheses for the right child should follow
     * those of the left child.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * Omitting Empty Parentheses: Any empty parentheses pairs (i.e., ()) should
     * be omitted from the final string representation of the tree, with one
     * specific exception: when a node has a right child but no left child. In
     * such cases, you must include an empty pair of parentheses to indicate the
     * absence of the left child. This ensures that the one-to-one mapping between
     * the string representation and the original binary tree structure is
     * maintained.
     * 
     * 
     * In summary, empty parentheses pairs should be omitted when a node has only
     * a left child or no children. However, when a node has a right child but no
     * left child, an empty pair of parentheses must precede the rep
