/**
 * <b>#3714 - Longest Balanced Substring II</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Hash Table, String, Prefix Sum</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given a string s consisting only of the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
 *
 *
 * A substring of s is called balanced if all distinct characters in the substring appear the same number of times.
 *
 *
 * Return the length of the longest balanced substring of s.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "abbac"
 *
 *
 * Output: 4
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * The longest balanced substring is "abba" because both distinct characters 'a' and 'b' each appear exactly 2 times.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "aabcc"
 *
 *
 * Output: 3
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * The longest balanced substring is "abc" because all distinct characters 'a', 'b' and 'c' each appear exactly 1 time.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: s = "aba"
 *
 *
 * Output: 2
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * One of the longest balanced substrings is "ab" because both distinct characters 'a' and 'b' each appear exactly 1 time. Another longest balanced substring is "ba".
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 105
 *
 * s contains only the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Solve for three cases: all-equal characters, exactly two distinct characters, and all three characters present. Treat each case separately and take the maximum length.
 * Hint 2: Case 1: single character: the longest balanced substring is the longest run of the same character; report its length.
 * Hint 3: Case 2: two distinct characters: reduce to that pair (ignore the third character) and use prefix differences of their counts; equal counts between two indices mean the substring between them is balanced for those two chars.
 * Hint 4: Case 3: all three characters: use prefix counts and hash the pair <code>(count_b - count_a, count_c - count_a)</code> for each prefix; if the same pair appears at two indices the substring between them has equal counts for a, b, and c. Store earliest index per pair to get maximal length.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Hash Table, String, Prefix Sum).
