/**
 * <b>#1169 - Invalid Transactions</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Hash Table, String, Sorting</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * A transaction is possibly invalid if:
 *
 *
 * the amount exceeds $1000, or;
 *
 * if it occurs within (and including) 60 minutes of another transaction with the same name in a different city.
 *
 * You are given an array of strings transaction where transactions[i] consists of comma-separated values representing the name, time (in minutes), amount, and city of the transaction.
 *
 *
 * Return a list of transactions that are possibly invalid. You may return the answer in any order.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: transactions = ["alice,20,800,mtv","alice,50,100,beijing"]
 * Output: ["alice,20,800,mtv","alice,50,100,beijing"]
 * Explanation: The first transaction is invalid because the second transaction occurs within a difference of 60 minutes, have the same name and is in a different city. Similarly the second one is invalid too.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: transactions = ["alice,20,800,mtv","alice,50,1200,mtv"]
 * Output: ["alice,50,1200,mtv"]
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: transactions = ["alice,20,800,mtv","bob,50,1200,mtv"]
 * Output: ["bob,50,1200,mtv"]
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * transactions.length &lt;= 1000
 *
 * Each transactions[i] takes the form "{name},{time},{amount},{city}"
 *
 * Each {name} and {city} consist of lowercase English letters, and have lengths between 1 and 10.
 *
 * Each {time} consist of digits, and represent an integer between 0 and 1000.
 *
 * Each {amount} consist of digits, and represent an integer between 0 and 2000.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Split each string into four arrays.
 * Hint 2: For each transaction check if it's invalid, you can do this with just a loop with help of the four arrays generated on step 1.
 * Hint 3: At the end you perform O(N ^ 2) operations.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Hash Table, String, Sorting).
 * Start brute-force, then optimise: sorting, hashing, two pointers,
 * sliding window, binary search, backtracking, DP, or graph traversal.
 *
 * <h2>Complexity</h2>
 * Time: see implementation  |  Space: see implementation
