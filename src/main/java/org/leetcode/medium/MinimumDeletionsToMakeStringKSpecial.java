/**
 * <b>#3085 - Minimum Deletions to Make String K-Special</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Hash Table, String, Greedy, Sorting, Counting</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given a string word and an integer k.
 *
 *
 * We consider word to be k-special if |freq(word[i]) - freq(word[j])| &lt;= k for all indices i and j in the string.
 *
 *
 * Here, freq(x) denotes the frequency of the character x in word, and |y| denotes the absolute value of y.
 *
 *
 * Return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make word k-special.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: word = "aabcaba", k = 0
 *
 *
 * Output: 3
 *
 *
 * Explanation: We can make word 0-special by deleting 2 occurrences of "a" and 1 occurrence of "c". Therefore, word becomes equal to "baba" where freq('a') == freq('b') == 2.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: word = "dabdcbdcdcd", k = 2
 *
 *
 * Output: 2
 *
 *
 * Explanation: We can make word 2-special by deleting 1 occurrence of "a" and 1 occurrence of "d". Therefore, word becomes equal to "bdcbdcdcd" where freq('b') == 2, freq('c') == 3, and freq('d') == 4.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: word = "aaabaaa", k = 2
 *
 *
 * Output: 1
 *
 *
 * Explanation: We can make word 2-special by deleting 1 occurrence of "b". Therefore, word becomes equal to "aaaaaa" where each letter's frequency is now uniformly 6.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= word.length &lt;= 105
 *
 * 0 &lt;= k &lt;= 105
 *
 * word consists only of lowercase English letters.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Count the frequency of each letter.
 * Hint 2: Suppose we select several characters as the final answer, and let <code>x</code> be the character with the smallest frequency in the answer. It can be shown that out of the selected characters, the optimal solution will never delete an occurrence of character <code>x</code> to obtain the answer.
 * Hint 3: We will fix a character <code>c</code> and assume that it will be the character with the smallest frequency in the answer. Suppose its frequency is <code>x</code>.
 * Hint 4: Then, for every other character, we will count the number of occurrences that will be deleted. Suppose that the current character has <code>y</code> occurrences. <ol> <li>If y &lt; x, we need to delete all of them.</li> <li> if y &gt; x + k, we should delete y - x - k of such character.</li> <li> Otherwise we don’t need to delete it.</li></ol>
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Hash Table, String, Greedy, Sorting, Counting).
