 * <b>#947 - Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Hash Table, Depth-First Search, Union-Find, Graph Theory</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * On a 2D plane, we place n stones at some integer coordinate points. Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.
 *
 *
 * A stone can be removed if it shares either the same row or the same column as another stone that has not been removed.
 *
 *
 * Given an array stones of length n where stones[i] = [xi, yi] represents the location of the ith stone, return the largest possible number of stones that can be removed.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: One way to remove 5 stones is as follows:
 * 1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,1].
 * 2. Remove stone [2,1] because it shares the same column as [0,1].
 * 3. Remove stone [1,2] because it shares the same row as [1,0].
 * 4. Remove stone [1,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].
 * 5. Remove stone [0,1] because it shares the same row as [0,0].
 * Stone [0,0] cannot be removed since it does not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,2],[1,1],[2,0],[2,2]]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: One way to make 3 moves is as follows:
 * 1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,0].
 * 2. Remove stone [2,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].
 * 3. Remove stone [0,2] because it shares the same row as [0,0].
 * Stones [0,0] and [1,1] cannot be removed since they do not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: stones = [[0,0]]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: [0,0] is the only stone on the plane, so you cannot remove it.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= stones.length &lt;= 1000
 *
 * 0 &lt;= xi, yi &lt;= 104
 *
 * No two stones are at the same coordinate point.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * No hints — trace through examples manually.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Hash Table, Depth-First Search, Union-Find, Graph Theory).
 * Start brute-force, then optimise: sorting, hashing, two pointers,
 * sliding window, binary search, backtracking, DP, or graph traversal.
 *
 * <h2>Complexity</h2>
 * Time: see implementation  |  Space: see implementation
