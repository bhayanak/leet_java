/**
 * <b>#2522 - Partition String Into Substrings With Values at Most K</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> String, Dynamic Programming, Greedy</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given a string s consisting of digits from 1 to 9 and an integer k.
 *
 *
 * A partition of a string s is called good if:
 *
 *
 * Each digit of s is part of exactly one substring.
 *
 * The value of each substring is less than or equal to k.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of substrings in a good partition of s. If no good partition of s exists, return -1.
 *
 *
 * Note that:
 *
 *
 * The value of a string is its result when interpreted as an integer. For example, the value of "123" is 123 and the value of "1" is 1.
 *
 * A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "165462", k = 60
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: We can partition the string into substrings "16", "54", "6", and "2". Each substring has a value less than or equal to k = 60.
 * It can be shown that we cannot partition the string into less than 4 substrings.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "238182", k = 5
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: There is no good partition for this string.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 105
 *
 * s[i] is a digit from '1' to '9'.
 *
 * 1 &lt;= k &lt;= 109
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * No hints -- trace through examples manually.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (String, Dynamic Programming, Greedy).
