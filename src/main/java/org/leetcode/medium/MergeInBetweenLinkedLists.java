/**
 * <b>#1669 - Merge In Between Linked Lists</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Linked List</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given two linked lists: list1 and list2 of sizes n and m respectively.
 *
 *
 * Remove list1's nodes from the ath node to the bth node, and put list2 in their place.
 *
 *
 * The blue edges and nodes in the following figure indicate the result:
 *
 *
 * Build the result list and return its head.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: list1 = [10,1,13,6,9,5], a = 3, b = 4, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002]
 * Output: [10,1,13,1000000,1000001,1000002,5]
 * Explanation: We remove the nodes 3 and 4 and put the entire list2 in their place. The blue edges and nodes in the above figure indicate the result.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: list1 = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6], a = 2, b = 5, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002,1000003,1000004]
 * Output: [0,1,1000000,1000001,1000002,1000003,1000004,6]
 * Explanation: The blue edges and nodes in the above figure indicate the result.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 3 &lt;= list1.length &lt;= 104
 *
 * 1 &lt;= a &lt;= b &lt; list1.length - 1
 *
 * 1 &lt;= list2.length &lt;= 104
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Check which edges need to be changed.
 * Hint 2: Let the next node of the (a-1)th node of list1 be the 0-th node in list 2.
 * Hint 3: Let the next node of the last node of list2 be the (b+1)-th node in list 1.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Linked List).
 * Start brute-force, then optimise: sorting, hashing, two pointers,
 * sliding window, binary search, backtracking, DP, or graph traversal.
 *
 * <h2>Complexity</h2>
 * Time: see implementation  |  Space: see implementation
