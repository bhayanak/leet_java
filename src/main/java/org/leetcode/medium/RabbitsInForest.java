     * LeetCode #781 – Rabbits in Forest
     * Difficulty: MEDIUM
     * Topics: Array, Hash Table, Math, Greedy
     *
     * There is a forest with an unknown number of rabbits. We asked n rabbits
     * "How many other rabbits have the same color as you?" and collected the
     * answers in an integer array answers where answers[i] is the answer of the
     * ith rabbit.
     * 
     * 
     * Given the array answers, return the minimum number of rabbits that could be
     * in the forest.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * Example 1:
     * 
     * Input: answers = [1,1,2]
     * Output: 5
     * Explanation:
     * The two rabbits that answered "1" could both be the same color, say red.
     * The rabbit that answered "2" can't be red or the answers would be
     * inconsistent.
     * Say the rabbit that answered "2" was blue.
     * Then there should be 2 other blue rabbits in the forest that didn't answer
     * into the array.
     * The smallest possible number of rabbits in the forest is therefore 5: 3
     * that answered plus 2 that didn't.
     * 
     * Example 2:
     * 
     * Input: answers = [10,10,10]
     * Output: 11
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * Constraints:
     * 
     * 
     * 1 &lt;= answers.length &lt;= 1000
     * 
     * 0 &lt;= answers[i] &lt; 1000
