/**
 * <b>#2266 - Count Number of Texts</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Hash Table, Math, String, Dynamic Programming</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * Alice is texting Bob using her phone. The mapping of digits to letters is shown in the figure below.
 *
 *
 * In order to add a letter, Alice has to press the key of the corresponding digit i times, where i is the position of the letter in the key.
 *
 *
 * For example, to add the letter 's', Alice has to press '7' four times. Similarly, to add the letter 'k', Alice has to press '5' twice.
 *
 * Note that the digits '0' and '1' do not map to any letters, so Alice does not use them.
 *
 * However, due to an error in transmission, Bob did not receive Alice's text message but received a string of pressed keys instead.
 *
 *
 * For example, when Alice sent the message "bob", Bob received the string "2266622".
 *
 * Given a string pressedKeys representing the string received by Bob, return the total number of possible text messages Alice could have sent.
 *
 *
 * Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: pressedKeys = "22233"
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation:
 * The possible text messages Alice could have sent are:
 * "aaadd", "abdd", "badd", "cdd", "aaae", "abe", "bae", and "ce".
 * Since there are 8 possible messages, we return 8.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: pressedKeys = "222222222222222222222222222222222222"
 * Output: 82876089
 * Explanation:
 * There are 2082876103 possible text messages Alice could have sent.
 * Since we need to return the answer modulo 109 + 7, we return 2082876103 % (109 + 7) = 82876089.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= pressedKeys.length &lt;= 105
 *
 * pressedKeys only consists of digits from '2' - '9'.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: For a substring consisting of the same digit, how can we count the number of texts it could have originally represented?
 * Hint 2: How can dynamic programming help us calculate the required answer?
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Hash Table, Math, String, Dynamic Programming).
