/**
 * <b>#2171 - Removing Minimum Number of Magic Beans</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Category:</b> Array, Greedy, Sorting, Enumeration, Prefix Sum</p>
 *
 * <h2>Problem Description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * You are given an array of positive integers beans, where each integer represents the number of magic beans found in a particular magic bag.
 *
 *
 * Remove any number of beans (possibly none) from each bag such that the number of beans in each remaining non-empty bag (still containing at least one bean) is equal. Once a bean has been removed from a bag, you are not allowed to return it to any of the bags.
 *
 *
 * Return the minimum number of magic beans that you have to remove.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: beans = [4,1,6,5]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: 
 * - We remove 1 bean from the bag with only 1 bean.
 *   This results in the remaining bags: [4,0,6,5]
 * - Then we remove 2 beans from the bag with 6 beans.
 *   This results in the remaining bags: [4,0,4,5]
 * - Then we remove 1 bean from the bag with 5 beans.
 *   This results in the remaining bags: [4,0,4,4]
 * We removed a total of 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 beans to make the remaining non-empty bags have an equal number of beans.
 * There are no other solutions that remove 4 beans or fewer.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: beans = [2,10,3,2]
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation:
 * - We remove 2 beans from one of the bags with 2 beans.
 *   This results in the remaining bags: [0,10,3,2]
 * - Then we remove 2 beans from the other bag with 2 beans.
 *   This results in the remaining bags: [0,10,3,0]
 * - Then we remove 3 beans from the bag with 3 beans. 
 *   This results in the remaining bags: [0,10,0,0]
 * We removed a total of 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 beans to make the remaining non-empty bags have an equal number of beans.
 * There are no other solutions that removes 7 beans or fewer.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 &lt;= beans.length &lt;= 105
 *
 * 1 &lt;= beans[i] &lt;= 105
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Hints to Solve</h2>
 * Hint 1: Notice that if we choose to make x bags of beans empty, we should choose the x bags with the least amount of beans.
 * Hint 2: Notice that if the minimum number of beans in a non-empty bag is m, then the best way to make all bags have an equal amount of beans is to reduce all the bags to have m beans.
 * Hint 3: Can we iterate over how many bags we should remove and choose the one that minimizes the total amount of beans to remove?
 * Hint 4: Sort the bags of beans first.
 *
 * <h2>Approach</h2>
 * Think about the category (Array, Greedy, Sorting, Enumeration, Prefix Sum).
